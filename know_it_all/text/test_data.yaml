- answer: Bath School of Pharmacy (founded 1907
  context: The University of Bath and Bath Spa University are higher education establishments
    in the north-east of the county. The University of Bath gained its Royal Charter
    in 1966, although its origins go back to the Bristol Trade School (founded 1856)
    and Bath School of Pharmacy (founded 1907). It has a purpose-built campus at Claverton
    on the outskirts of Bath, and has 15,000 students. Bath Spa University, which
    is based at Newton St Loe, achieved university status in 2005, and has origins
    including the Bath Academy of Art (founded 1898), Bath Teacher Training College,
    and the Bath College of Higher Education. It has several campuses and 5,500 students.

- answer: Greg Mullen
  context: The City of Charleston Police Department, with a total of 452 sworn officers,
    137 civilians, and 27 reserve police officers, is South Carolina's largest police
    department. Their procedures on cracking down on drug use and gang violence in
    the city are used as models to other cities to do the same.[citation needed] According
    to the final 2005 FBI Crime Reports, Charleston crime level is worse than the
    national average in almost every major category. Greg Mullen, the former Deputy
    Chief of the Virginia Beach, Virginia Police Department, serves as the current
    Chief of the Charleston Police Department. The former Charleston police chief
    was Reuben Greenberg, who resigned August 12, 2005. Greenberg was credited with
    creating a polite police force that kept police brutality well in check, even
    as it developed a visible presence in community policing and a significant reduction
    in crime rates.
  question: Who is the current Chief of the Charleston Police Department?
- answer: dopamine
  context: "Most organisms studied to date utilize a reward\u2013punishment mechanism:\
    \ for instance, worms and insects can alter their behavior to seek food sources\
    \ or to avoid dangers. In vertebrates, the reward-punishment system is implemented\
    \ by a specific set of brain structures, at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia,\
    \ a set of interconnected areas at the base of the forebrain. There is substantial\
    \ evidence that the basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are\
    \ made: the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the\
    \ motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system\
    \ is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out. Rewards and\
    \ punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the\
    \ basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward\
    \ mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role\
    \ in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively. Research has shown\
    \ that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs such\
    \ as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or\
    \ cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced."
  question: Which neurotransmitter plays a large role in drug abuse?
- answer: Estophile educated class
  context: "Writings in Estonian became significant only in the 19th century with\
    \ the spread of the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment, during the Estophile Enlightenment\
    \ Period (1750\u20131840). Although Baltic Germans at large regarded the future\
    \ of Estonians as being a fusion with themselves, the Estophile educated class\
    \ admired the ancient culture of the Estonians and their era of freedom before\
    \ the conquests by Danes and Germans in the 13th century."
  question: Who had admiration for the ancient Estonian culture?
- answer: July 25, 2011
  context: Midtown Raleigh is a residential and commercial area just North of the
    I-440 Beltline and is part of North Raleigh. It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Creedmoor
    Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North.
    It includes shopping centers such as North Hills and Crabtree Valley Mall. It
    also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System. The term
    was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and
    planning director Mitchell Silver. The News & Observer newspaper started using
    the term for marketing purposes only. The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded
    on July 25, 2011 as a way for community leaders to promote the area.
  question: When was the Midtown Raleigh Alliance formed?
- answer: Chen Yuanguang
  context: "In 677 (during the reign of Emperor Gaozong), Chen Zheng (\u9673\u653F\
    ), together with his son Chen Yuanguang (\u9673\u5143\u5149), led a military expedition\
    \ to pacify the rebellion in Fujian. They settled in Zhangzhou and brought the\
    \ Middle Chinese phonology of northern China during the 7th century into Zhangzhou;\
    \ In 885, (during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang), the two brothers Wang\
    \ Chao (\u738B\u6F6E) and Wang Shenzhi (\u738B\u5BE9\u77E5), led a military expedition\
    \ force to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion. They brought the Middle Chinese phonology\
    \ commonly spoken in Northern China into Zhangzhou. These two waves of migrations\
    \ from the north generally brought the language of northern Middle Chinese into\
    \ the Fujian region. This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect."
  question: What is the name of the son of Chen Zheng?
- answer: Royal Princess
  context: The city has a particular connection to Cunard Line and their fleet of
    ships. This was particularly evident on 11 November 2008 when the Cunard liner
    RMS Queen Elizabeth 2 departed the city for the final time amid a spectacular
    fireworks display after a full day of celebrations. Cunard ships are regularly
    launched in the city, for example Queen Victoria was named by HRH The Duchess
    of Cornwall in December 2007, and the Queen named Queen Elizabeth in the city
    during October 2011. The Duchess of Cambridge performed the naming ceremony of
    Royal Princess on 13 June 2013.
  question: What ship did the Duchess of Cambridge christen on June 13, 2013?
- answer: November 11, 2006
  context: "Owing to economic conditions and the late 2000s recession, many of the\
    \ proposed mega casinos never went further than the initial planning stages. One\
    \ of these developers was Pinnacle Entertainment, who purchased the Sands Atlantic\
    \ City, only to close it permanently November 11, 2006. The following year, the\
    \ resort was demolished in a dramatic, Las Vegas styled implosion, the first of\
    \ its kind in Atlantic City. While Pinnacle Entertainment intended to replace\
    \ it with a $1.5\u20132 billion casino resort, the company canceled its construction\
    \ plans and plans to sell the land. The biggest disappointment was when MGM Resorts\
    \ International announced that it would pull out of all development for Atlantic\
    \ City, effectively ending their plans for the MGM Grand Atlantic City."
  question: When did the Sands Atlantic City close permanently?
- answer: American civil procedure
  context: Generally, American civil procedure has several notable features, including
    extensive pretrial discovery, heavy reliance on live testimony obtained at deposition
    or elicited in front of a jury, and aggressive pretrial "law and motion" practice
    designed to result in a pretrial disposition (that is, summary judgment) or a
    settlement. U.S. courts pioneered the concept of the opt-out class action, by
    which the burden falls on class members to notify the court that they do not wish
    to be bound by the judgment, as opposed to opt-in class actions, where class members
    must join into the class. Another unique feature is the so-called American Rule
    under which parties generally bear their own attorneys' fees (as opposed to the
    English Rule of "loser pays"), though American legislators and courts have carved
    out numerous exceptions.
  question: What is extensive pretrial discovery a part of?
- answer: World War I.
  context: "Italian unification was the political and social movement that annexed\
    \ different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of Italy in\
    \ the 19th century. There is a lack of consensus on the exact dates for the beginning\
    \ and the end of this period, but many scholars agree that the process began with\
    \ the end of Napoleonic rule and the Congress of Vienna in 1815, and approximately\
    \ ended with the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, though the last citt\xE0 irredente\
    \ did not join the Kingdom of Italy until after World War I."
  question: After what event did the last citta irredente join Italy?
- answer: Anglo-Celtic Isles
  context: The earliest known use of the phrase Brytish Iles in the English language
    is dated 1577 in a work by John Dee. Today, this name is seen by some as carrying
    imperialist overtones although it is still commonly used. Other names used to
    describe the islands include the Anglo-Celtic Isles, Atlantic archipelago, British-Irish
    Isles, Britain and Ireland, UK and Ireland, and British Isles and Ireland. Owing
    to political and national associations with the word British, the Government of
    Ireland does not use the term British Isles and in documents drawn up jointly
    between the British and Irish governments, the archipelago is referred to simply
    as "these islands". Nonetheless, British Isles is still the most widely accepted
    term for the archipelago.
  question: What is another name that is used for the British Isles?
- answer: a "culturally relative definition"
  context: Definitions of literature have varied over time; it is a "culturally relative
    definition". In Western Europe prior to the eighteenth century, literature as
    a term indicated all books and writing. A more restricted sense of the term emerged
    during the Romantic period, in which it began to demarcate "imaginative" literature.
    Contemporary debates over what constitutes literature can be seen as returning
    to the older, more inclusive notion of what constitutes literature. Cultural studies,
    for instance, takes as its subject of analysis both popular and minority genres,
    in addition to canonical works.
  question: The changing nature of the meaning of the term "literature" can be described
    as what?
- answer: carbon dioxide emissions
  context: Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006 allowing
    California to work with the Northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They
    plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon
    credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed
    emissions for the amount of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits
    to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009. In addition to using his
    political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home
    to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his
    Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed
    solar panels to heat his home.
  question: What particular pollutant was Schwarzenegger addressing with his 2006
    executive order?
- answer: 4,550
  context: As a foreign language, Dutch is mainly taught in primary and secondary
    schools in areas adjacent to the Netherlands and Flanders. In French-speaking
    Belgium, over 300,000 pupils are enrolled in Dutch courses, followed by over 23,000
    in the German states of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia, and about 7,000
    in the French region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais (of which 4,550 are in primary school).
    At an academic level, the largest number of faculties of neerlandistiek can be
    found in Germany (30 universities), followed by France (20 universities) and the
    United Kingdom (5 universities).
  question: How many primary school students are learning Dutch in Nord-Pas-de-Calais?
- answer: Bingo was introduced as a marketing tool and a 2p drop in cover price
  context: The Daily Star had been launched in 1978 by Express Newspaper, and by 1981
    had begun to affect sales of The Sun. Bingo was introduced as a marketing tool
    and a 2p drop in cover price removed the Daily Star's competitive advantage opening
    a new circulation battle which resulted in The Sun neutralising the threat of
    the new paper. The new editor of The Sun, Kelvin MacKenzie, took up his post in
    1981 just after these developments, and "changed the British tabloid concept more
    profoundly than [Larry] Lamb did", according to Bruce Page, MacKenzie The paper
    became "more outrageous, opinionated and irreverent than anything ever produced
    in Britain".
  question: What helped the Sun overcome the Daily Star's challenge?
- answer: to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource
  context: New Zealand has a strong hunting culture. The islands making up New Zealand
    originally had no land mammals apart from bats. However, once Europeans arrived,
    game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders
    with sport and a hunting resource. Deer, pigs, goats, rabbits, hare, tahr and
    chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain, and with no natural predators,
    their population exploded. Government agencies view the animals as pests due to
    their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production, but hunters
    view them as a resource.
  question: Why were game animals introduced by acclimatisation societies?
- answer: English
  context: A standard dialect (also known as a standardized dialect or "standard language")
    is a dialect that is supported by institutions. Such institutional support may
    include government recognition or designation; presentation as being the "correct"
    form of a language in schools; published grammars, dictionaries, and textbooks
    that set forth a correct spoken and written form; and an extensive formal literature
    that employs that dialect (prose, poetry, non-fiction, etc.). There may be multiple
    standard dialects associated with a single language. For example, Standard American
    English, Standard British English, Standard Canadian English, Standard Indian
    English, Standard Australian English, and Standard Philippine English may all
    be said to be standard dialects of the English language.
  question: Standard Philippine English is a standard dialect of of what language?
- answer: digital blocks which make up each independent frame
  context: 'LaserDisc was a composite video format: the luminance (black and white)
    and chrominance (color) information were transmitted in one signal, separated
    by the receiver. While good comb filters can do so adequately, these two signals
    cannot be completely separated. On DVDs, data is stored in the form of digital
    blocks which make up each independent frame. The signal produced is dependent
    on the equipment used to master the disc. Signals range from composite and split,
    to YUV and RGB. Depending upon which format is used, this can result in far higher
    fidelity, particularly at strong color borders or regions of high detail (especially
    if there is moderate movement in the picture) and low-contrast details like skin
    tones, where comb filters almost inevitably smudge some detail.'
  question: How is data stored on DVDs?
- answer: tituli
  context: The term cardinal at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned
    or incardinated to a church, or specifically to the senior priest of an important
    church, based on the Latin cardo (hinge), meaning "principal" or "chief". The
    term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of
    the tituli (parishes) of the diocese of Rome. The Church of England retains an
    instance of this origin of the title, which is held by the two senior members
    of the College of Minor Canons of St Paul's Cathedral.
  question: The Church of England uses what term that is held by two senior members
    of the College of Minor Canons of St. Pauls Catherdral?
- answer: Sunset Limited, which travels across the southern United States via New
    Orleans, Houston, and San Antonio to its western terminus of Los Angeles
  context: 'Florida is served by Amtrak, operating numerous lines throughout, connecting
    the state''s largest cities to points north in the United States and Canada. The
    busiest Amtrak train stations in Florida in 2011 were: Sanford (259,944), Orlando
    (179,142), Tampa Union Station (140,785), Miami (94,556), and Jacksonville (74,733).
    Sanford, in Greater Orlando, is the southern terminus of the Auto Train, which
    originates at Lorton, Virginia, south of Washington, D.C.. Until 2005, Orlando
    was also the eastern terminus of the Sunset Limited, which travels across the
    southern United States via New Orleans, Houston, and San Antonio to its western
    terminus of Los Angeles. Florida is served by two additional Amtrak trains (the
    Silver Star and the Silver Meteor), which operate between New York City and Miami.
    Miami Central Station, the city''s rapid transit, commuter rail, intercity rail,
    and bus hub, is under construction.'
  question: Who does sunset limited service
- answer: 27 BC
  context: However, civil war flared again when the Second Triumvirate of Octavian,
    Lepidus and Mark Antony failed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base of patronage
    and then launched a campaign against Mark Antony. At the naval Battle of Actium
    off the coast of Greece, Octavian decisively defeated Antony and Cleopatra. Octavian
    was granted a series of special powers including sole "imperium" within the city
    of Rome, permanent consular powers and credit for every Roman military victory,
    since all future generals were assumed to be acting under his command. In 27 BC
    Octavian was granted the use of the names "Augustus" and "Princeps", indicating
    his primary status above all other Romans, and he adopted the title "Imperator
    Caesar" making him the first Roman Emperor.
  question: In what year was Octavian first allowed to use the names Augustus and
    Princeps?
- answer: the testing of higher level components
  context: Bottom Up Testing is an approach to integrated testing where the lowest
    level components (modules, procedures, and functions) are tested first, then integrated
    and used to facilitate the testing of higher level components. After the integration
    testing of lower level integrated modules, the next level of modules will be formed
    and can be used for integration testing. The process is repeated until the components
    at the top of the hierarchy are tested. This approach is helpful only when all
    or most of the modules of the same development level are ready.[citation needed]
    This method also helps to determine the levels of software developed and makes
    it easier to report testing progress in the form of a percentage.[citation needed]
  question: Bottom Up Testing helps facilitate the testing of what?
- answer: Raleigh
  context: On November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify
    the Constitution. In 1840, it completed the state capitol building in Raleigh,
    still standing today. Most of North Carolina's slave owners and large plantations
    were located in the eastern portion of the state. Although North Carolina's plantation
    system was smaller and less cohesive than that of Virginia, Georgia, or South
    Carolina, significant numbers of planters were concentrated in the counties around
    the port cities of Wilmington and Edenton, as well as suburban planters around
    the cities of Raleigh, Charlotte, and Durham in the Piedmont. Planters owning
    large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum
    North Carolina, which was a slave society. They placed their interests above those
    of the generally non-slave-holding "yeoman" farmers of western North Carolina.
    In mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction
    of a 129-mile (208 km) wooden plank road, known as a "farmer's railroad", from
    Fayetteville in the east to Bethania (northwest of Winston-Salem).
  question: Where was the capitol building completed in 1840?
- answer: '100'
  context: Israeli universities are among 100 top world universities in mathematics
    (Hebrew University, TAU and Technion), physics (TAU, Hebrew University and Weizmann
    Institute of Science), chemistry (Technion and Weizmann Institute of Science),
    computer science (Weizmann Institute of Science, Technion, Hebrew University,
    TAU and BIU) and economics (Hebrew University and TAU). Israel has produced six
    Nobel Prize-winning scientists since 2002 and has been frequently ranked as one
    of the countries with the highest ratios of scientific papers per capita in the
    world. Israel has led the world in stem-cell research papers per capita since
    2000.
  question: Israeli universities rank where in mathematics?
- answer: '1917'
  context: 'Another action in 1917 that is of note was the armistice signed between
    Russia and the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk. As a condition for peace, the
    treaty by the Central Powers conceded huge portions of the former Russian Empire
    to Imperial Germany and the Ottoman Empire, greatly upsetting nationalists and
    conservatives. The Bolsheviks made peace with the German Empire and the Central
    Powers, as they had promised the Russian people prior to the Revolution. Vladimir
    Lenin''s decision has been attributed to his sponsorship by the foreign office
    of Wilhelm II, German Emperor, offered by the latter in hopes that with a revolution,
    Russia would withdraw from World War I. This suspicion was bolstered by the German
    Foreign Ministry''s sponsorship of Lenin''s return to Petrograd. The Western Allies
    expressed their dismay at the Bolsheviks, upset at:'
  question: When was the armistice signed between Russia and Central powers?
- answer: 200 billion
  context: In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about
    30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide. CDs are increasingly
    being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result
    that audio CD sales rates in the U.S. have dropped about 50% from their peak;
    however, they remain one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry.
    In 2014, revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format
    sales for the first time.
  question: How many CDs had been distrubuted worldwide by 2007?
- answer: 16,539
  context: Public schools are part of the Ann Arbor Public Schools (AAPS) district.
    AAPS has one of the country's leading music programs. In September 2008, 16,539
    students had been enrolled in the Ann Arbor Public Schools. There were 21 elementary
    schools, five middle schools (Forsythe, Slauson, Tappan, Scarlett, and Clague)
    three traditional high schools (Pioneer, Huron, and Skyline), and three alternative
    high schools (Community High, Stone School, and Roberto Clemente) in the district.
    The district also operates a K-8 open school program, Ann Arbor Open School, out
    of the former Mack School. This program is open to all families who live within
    the district. Ann Arbor Public Schools also operates a preschool and family center,
    with programs for at-risk infants and children before kindergarten. The district
    has a preschool center with both free and tuition-based programs for preschoolers
    in the district.
  question: In 2008, how many were enrolled in public schools?
- answer: the legal basis of voivodship sejmiks
  context: "In 1454 King Casimir IV granted the Nieszawa Statutes (Polish: \"statuty\
    \ cerkwicko-nieszawskie\"), clarifying the legal basis of voivodship sejmiks (local\
    \ parliaments). The king could promulgate new laws, raise taxes, or call for a\
    \ lev\xE9e en masse (pospolite ruszenie) only with the consent of the sejmiks,\
    \ and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses. The Nieszawa Statutes\
    \ also curbed the power of the magnates, as the Sejm (national parliament) received\
    \ the right to elect many officials, including judges, voivods and castellans.\
    \ These privileges were demanded by the szlachta as a compensation for their participation\
    \ in the Thirteen Years' War."
  question: What did the Nieszawa statues clarify?
- answer: Charles Darwin
  context: Charles Darwin's book The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action
    of Worms (1881) presented the first scientific analysis of earthworms' contributions
    to soil fertility. Some burrow while others live entirely on the surface, generally
    in moist leaf litter. The burrowers loosen the soil so that oxygen and water can
    penetrate it, and both surface and burrowing worms help to produce soil by mixing
    organic and mineral matter, by accelerating the decomposition of organic matter
    and thus making it more quickly available to other organisms, and by concentrating
    minerals and converting them to forms that plants can use more easily. Earthworms
    are also important prey for birds ranging in size from robins to storks, and for
    mammals ranging from shrews to badgers, and in some cases conserving earthworms
    may be essential for conserving endangered birds.
  question: Who published a book about worms in 1881?
- answer: peripheral oscillators
  context: More-or-less independent circadian rhythms are found in many organs and
    cells in the body outside the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the "master clock".
    These clocks, called peripheral oscillators, are found in the adrenal gland,[citation
    needed] oesophagus, lungs, liver, pancreas, spleen, thymus, and skin.[citation
    needed] Though oscillators in the skin respond to light, a systemic influence
    has not been proven. There is also some evidence that the olfactory bulb and prostate
    may experience oscillations when cultured, suggesting that these structures may
    also be weak oscillators.[citation needed]
  question: What is the term for the independent clocks?
- answer: that gene's function
  context: Genetic engineering is now a routine research tool with model organisms.
    For example, genes are easily added to bacteria and lineages of knockout mice
    with a specific gene's function disrupted are used to investigate that gene's
    function. Many organisms have been genetically modified for applications in agriculture,
    industrial biotechnology, and medicine.
  question: What do scientists explore by adding genes to mice with a certain gene's
    function disrupted?
- answer: y science-fiction and adventure
  context: In a career spanning more than four decades, Spielberg's films have covered
    many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films
    were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years,
    his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the Holocaust (in Schindler's
    List), the transatlantic slave trade (in Amistad), war (in Empire of the Sun,
    Saving Private Ryan, War Horse and Bridge of Spies) and terrorism (in Munich).
    His other films include Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones
    film series, and A.I. Artificial Intelligence.
  question: What type of films did Spielberg find early success with?
- answer: 1880s-1920s
  context: "Prior to the Golden Age of Mandolins, France had a history with the mandolin,\
    \ with mandolinists playing in Paris until the Napoleonic Wars. The players, teachers\
    \ and composers included Giovanni Fouchetti, Eduardo Mezzacapo, Gabriele Leon,\
    \ and Gervasio. During the Golden age itself (1880s-1920s), the mandolin had a\
    \ strong presence in France. Prominent mandolin players or composers included\
    \ Jules Cottin and his sister Madeleine Cottin, Jean Pietrapertosa, and Edgar\
    \ Bara. Paris had dozens of \"estudiantina\" mandolin orchestras in the early\
    \ 1900s. Mandolin magazines included L'Estudiantina, Le Plectre, \xC9cole de la\
    \ mandolie."
  question: What years was considered the Golden Age of Mandolins?
- answer: Hunting
  context: Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal, or pursuing
    or tracking it with the intent of doing so. Hunting wildlife or feral animals
    is most commonly done by humans for food, recreation, to remove predators which
    are dangerous to humans or domestic animals, or for trade. In the 2010s, lawful
    hunting is distinguished from poaching, which is the illegal killing, trapping
    or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred to
    as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds.
  question: What is it called to kill or trap an animal?
- answer: two
  context: An MP3 file is made up of MP3 frames, which consist of a header and a data
    block. This sequence of frames is called an elementary stream. Due to the "byte
    reservoir", frames are not independent items and cannot usually be extracted on
    arbitrary frame boundaries. The MP3 Data blocks contain the (compressed) audio
    information in terms of frequencies and amplitudes. The diagram shows that the
    MP3 Header consists of a sync word, which is used to identify the beginning of
    a valid frame. This is followed by a bit indicating that this is the MPEG standard
    and two bits that indicate that layer 3 is used; hence MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 or
    MP3. After this, the values will differ, depending on the MP3 file. ISO/IEC 11172-3
    defines the range of values for each section of the header along with the specification
    of the header. Most MP3 files today contain ID3 metadata, which precedes or follows
    the MP3 frames, as noted in the diagram.
  question: How many bits are needed to indicate that layer 3 is used?
- answer: Mary Beth Cahill
  context: In sheer numbers, Kerry had fewer endorsements than Howard Dean, who was
    far ahead in the superdelegate race going into the Iowa caucuses in January 2004,
    although Kerry led the endorsement race in Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, South
    Carolina, New Mexico and Nevada. Kerry's main perceived weakness was in his neighboring
    state of New Hampshire and nearly all national polls. Most other states did not
    have updated polling numbers to give an accurate placing for the Kerry campaign
    before Iowa. Heading into the primaries, Kerry's campaign was largely seen as
    in trouble, particularly after he fired campaign manager Jim Jordan. The key factors
    enabling it to survive were when fellow Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy assigned
    Mary Beth Cahill to be the campaign manager, as well as Kerry's mortgaging his
    own home to lend the money to his campaign (while his wife was a billionaire,
    campaign finance rules prohibited using one's personal fortune). He also brought
    on the "magical" Michael Whouley who would be credited with helping bring home
    the Iowa victory the same as he did in New Hampshire for Al Gore in 2000 against
    Bill Bradley.
  question: Who took over for Jim Jordon, when he was fired?
- answer: Porifera, Ctenophora, Cnidaria and Placozoa
  context: 'Traditional morphological and modern molecular phylogenetic analysis have
    both recognized a major evolutionary transition from "non-bilaterian" animals,
    which are those lacking a bilaterally symmetric body plan (Porifera, Ctenophora,
    Cnidaria and Placozoa), to "bilaterian" animals (Bilateria) whose body plans display
    bilateral symmetry. The latter are further classified based on a major division
    between Deuterostomes and Protostomes. The relationships among non-bilaterian
    animals are disputed, but all bilaterian animals are thought to form a monophyletic
    group. Current understanding of the relationships among the major groups of animals
    is summarized by the following cladogram:'
  question: What are some examples of non-bilaterian animals?
- answer: Welsh-Ryan Arena
  context: The football team plays at Ryan Field (formerly known as Dyche Stadium);
    the basketball, wrestling, and volleyball teams play at Welsh-Ryan Arena. Northwestern's
    athletic teams are nicknamed the Wildcats. Before 1924, they were known as "The
    Purple" and unofficially as "The Fighting Methodists." The name Wildcats was bestowed
    upon the university in 1924 by Wallace Abbey, a writer for the Chicago Daily Tribune
    who wrote that even in a loss to the University of Chicago, "Football players
    had not come down from Evanston; wildcats would be a name better suited to [Coach
    Glenn] Thistletwaite's boys." The name was so popular that university board members
    made "wildcats" the official nickname just months later. In 1972, the student
    body voted to change the official nickname from "Wildcats" to "Purple Haze" but
    the new name never stuck.
  question: Where do Northwestern's basketball, wrestling, and volleyball teams play?
- answer: lies in plant Hardiness zone 9b
  context: "The climate of Cork, like the rest of Ireland, is mild and changeable\
    \ with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. Cork lies in plant\
    \ Hardiness zone 9b. Met \xC9ireann maintains a climatological weather station\
    \ at Cork Airport, a few kilometres south of the city. It should be noted that\
    \ the airport is at an altitude of 151 metres (495 ft) and temperatures can often\
    \ differ by a few degrees between the airport and the city itself. There are also\
    \ smaller synoptic weather stations at UCC and Clover Hill."
  question: If you are going to farm in Cork, what should you be aware of?
- answer: DW Kanye West
  context: "On October 1, 2011, Kanye West premiered his women's fashion label, DW\
    \ Kanye West at Paris Fashion Week. He received support from DSquared2 duo Dean\
    \ and Dan Caten, Olivier Theyskens, Jeremy Scott, Azzedine Ala\xEFa, and the Olsen\
    \ twins, who were also in attendance during his show. His debut fashion show received\
    \ mixed-to-negative reviews, ranging from reserved observations by Style.com to\
    \ excoriating commentary by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, the International\
    \ Herald Tribune, Elleuk.com, The Daily Telegraph, Harper's Bazaar and many others.\
    \ On March 6, 2012, West premiered a second fashion line at Paris Fashion Week.\
    \ The line's reception was markedly improved from the previous presentation, with\
    \ a number of critics heralding West for his \"much improved\" sophomore effort."
  question: What was the name of Kanye West's women's clothing line?
- answer: head of defence procurement
  context: "The most notable fraud conviction was that of Gordon Foxley, head of defence\
    \ procurement at the Ministry of Defence from 1981 to 1984. Police claimed he\
    \ received at least \xA33.5m in total in corrupt payments, such as substantial\
    \ bribes from overseas arms contractors aiming to influence the allocation of\
    \ contracts."
  question: What position was held by Foxley?
- answer: the only country with successful public broadcasting of analog HDTV
  context: In addition, recording and reproducing an HDTV signal was a significant
    technical challenge in the early years of HDTV (Sony HDVS). Japan remained the
    only country with successful public broadcasting of analog HDTV, with seven broadcasters
    sharing a single channel.
  question: What accomplishment in early HDTV did Japan have?
- answer: Candidate Conservation Agreements With Assurances(CCA) are meant to protect
    unlisted species
  context: The Candidate Conservation Agreement is closely related to the "Safe Harbor"
    agreement, the main difference is that the Candidate Conservation Agreements With
    Assurances(CCA) are meant to protect unlisted species by providing incentives
    to private landowners and land managing agencies to restore, enhance or maintain
    habitat of unlisted species which are declining and have the potential to become
    threatened or endangered if critical habitat is not protected. The FWS will then
    assure that if, in the future the unlisted species becomes listed, the landowner
    will not be required to do more than already agreed upon in the CCA.
  question: How do Candidate Conservation Agreements differ from Safe Harbor agreements?
- answer: '13.1'
  context: "The average net household income (after social, pension and health insurance\
    \ contributions) in Paris was \u20AC36,085 for 2011. It ranged from \u20AC22,095\
    \ in the 19th arrondissement to \u20AC82,449 in the 7th arrondissement. The median\
    \ taxable income for 2011 was around \u20AC25,000 in Paris and \u20AC22,200 for\
    \ \xCEle-de-France. Generally speaking, incomes are higher in the Western part\
    \ of the city and in the western suburbs than in the northern and eastern parts\
    \ of the urban area.[citation needed] Unemployment was estimated at 8.2 percent\
    \ in the city of Paris and 8.8 percent in the \xCEle-de-France region in the first\
    \ trimester of 2015. It ranged from 7.6 percent in the wealthy Essonne department\
    \ to 13.1 percent in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, where many recent immigrants\
    \ live."
  question: What was the unemployment rate in the Siene-Saint-Denis department?
- answer: Carnival Tuesday
  context: Carnival Tuesday hosts the main events. Full costume is worn, complete
    with make-up and body paint/adornment. Usually "Mas Boots" that complement the
    costumes are worn. Each band has their costume presentation based on a particular
    theme, and contains various sections (some consisting of thousands of revelers)
    that reflect these themes. The street parade and band costume competition take
    place. The mas bands eventually converge on the Queen's Park Savannah to pass
    on "The Stage" for judging. The singer of the most played song is crowned Road
    March King or Queen earning prize money and usually a vehicle.
  question: On what day is full costume worn?
- answer: The most basic rule is that an action must be seen by a referee to be declared
    for a fall or disqualification.
  context: Due to the legitimate role that referees play in wrestling of serving as
    liaison between the bookers backstage and the wrestlers in the ring (the role
    of being a final arbitrator is merely kayfabe), the referee is present, even in
    matches that do not at first glance appear to require a referee (such as a ladder
    match, as it is no holds barred, and the criteria for victory could theoretically
    be assessed from afar). Although their actions are also frequently scripted for
    dramatic effect, referees are subject to certain general rules and requirements
    in order to maintain the theatrical appearance of unbiased authority. The most
    basic rule is that an action must be seen by a referee to be declared for a fall
    or disqualification. This allows for heel characters to gain a scripted advantage
    by distracting or disabling the referee in order to perform some ostensibly illegal
    maneuver on their opponent. Most referees are unnamed and essentially anonymous,
    though the WWE has let their officials reveal their names.
  question: What is a common rule about referees?
- answer: the State Magazine
  context: The government, consisting of the monarch and the ministers, will then
    usually approve the proposal and the sovereign and one of the ministers signs
    the proposal with the addition of an enacting clause, thereafter notifying the
    States General that "The King assents to the proposal." It has happened in exceptional
    circumstances that the government does not approve a law that has been passed
    in parliament. In such a case, neither the monarch nor a minister will sign the
    bill, notifying the States General that "The King will keep the proposal under
    advisement." A law that has received royal assent will be published in the State
    Magazine, with the original being kept in the archives of the King's Offices.
  question: Where are laws published after receiving assent?
- answer: "Sebasti\xE3o de Melo"
  context: "As the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him\
    \ with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebasti\xE3o de Melo was made Prime\
    \ Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from the\
    \ Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar economic policies in Portugal.\
    \ He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India; reorganized\
    \ the army and the navy; restructured the University of Coimbra, and ended discrimination\
    \ against different Christian sects in Portugal."
  question: Who abolished slavery in Portugal?
- answer: Michael Fagan
  context: During the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony and only six weeks before
    the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were
    fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse, Burmese.
    Police later discovered that the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant,
    Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three.
    The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.
    From April to September 1982, the Queen remained anxious but proud of her son,
    Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War. On
    9 July, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder,
    Michael Fagan, in the room with her. Remaining calm and through two calls to the
    Palace police switchboard, she spoke to Fagan while he sat at the foot of her
    bed until assistance arrived seven minutes later. Though she hosted US President
    Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visited his Californian ranch in 1983,
    she was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of
    her Caribbean realms, without informing her.
  question: Who was the intruder Elizabeth awoke to find in her bedroom?
- answer: Trafalgar Square
  context: "Dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war was growing with the public\
    \ in the UK and in other countries, aggravated by reports of fiascos, especially\
    \ the humiliating defeat of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava.\
    \ On Sunday, 21 January 1855, a \"snowball riot\" occurred in Trafalgar Square\
    \ near St. Martin-in-the-Field in which 1,500 people gathered to protest against\
    \ the war by pelting buses, cabs, and pedestrians with snow balls. When the police\
    \ intervened, the snowballs were directed at them. The riot was finally put down\
    \ by troops and police acting with truncheons. In Parliament, Tories demanded\
    \ an accounting of all soldiers, cavalry and sailors sent to the Crimea and accurate\
    \ figures as to the number of casualties that had been sustained by all British\
    \ armed forces in the Crimea; they were especially concerned with the Battle of\
    \ Balaclava. When Parliament passed a bill to investigate by the vote of 305 to\
    \ 148, Aberdeen said he had lost a vote of no confidence and resigned as prime\
    \ minister on 30 January 1855. The veteran former Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston\
    \ became prime minister. Palmerston took a hard line; he wanted to expand the\
    \ war, foment unrest inside the Russian Empire, and permanently reduce the Russian\
    \ threat to Europe. Sweden and Prussia were willing to join the UK and France,\
    \ and Russia was isolated.:400\u2013402, 406\u2013408"
  question: On January 21 1855, where did people protest the war?
- answer: eight
  context: The current "Precentor" (Head of Music) is Tim Johnson, and the School
    boasts eight organs and an entire building for music (performance spaces include
    the School Hall, the Farrer Theatre and two halls dedicated to music, the Parry
    Hall and the Concert Hall). Many instruments are taught, including obscure ones
    such as the didgeridoo. The School participates in many national competitions;
    many pupils are part of the National Youth Orchestra, and the School gives scholarships
    for dedicated and talented musicians. A former Precentor of the college, Ralph
    Allwood set up and organised Eton Choral Courses, which run at the School every
    summer.
  question: How many organs does Eton house?
- answer: '1'
  context: It has been revealed that Southampton has the worst behaved secondary schools
    within the UK. With suspension rates three times the national average, the suspension
    rate is approximately 1 in every 14 children, the highest in the country for physical
    or verbal assaults against staff.
  question: Out of about every 14 students, how many will be suspended from school?
- answer: 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein
  context: Poultry meat and eggs provide nutritionally beneficial food containing
    protein of high quality. This is accompanied by low levels of fat which have a
    favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about two to three times
    as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured by weight.
    However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100-g
    serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared
    to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt
    steak.
  question: What is the fat and protien content of a 100g ram serving of baked chicken
    breast contain ?
- answer: clothing
  context: "In 2008, the BBC reported that the company Primark was using child labor\
    \ in the manufacture of clothing. In particular, a \xA34 hand-embroidered shirt\
    \ was the starting point of a documentary produced by BBC's Panorama programme.\
    \ The programme asks consumers to ask themselves, \"Why am I only paying \xA3\
    4 for a hand embroidered top? This item looks handmade. Who made it for such little\
    \ cost?\", in addition to exposing the violent side of the child labour industry\
    \ in countries where child exploitation is prevalent."
  question: What does Primark produce?
- answer: '"a state of devastation in which surrender is inevitable."'
  context: 'AOC Bomber Command Arthur Harris did see German morale as a major objective.
    However, he did not believe that the morale-collapse could occur without the destruction
    of the German economy. The primary goal of Bomber Command''s offensives was to
    destroy the German industrial base (economic warfare), and in doing so reduce
    morale. In late 1943, just before the Battle of Berlin, he declared the power
    of Bomber Command would enable it to achieve "a state of devastation in which
    surrender is inevitable." A summary of Harris'' strategic intentions was clear:'
  question: Arthur Harris announced that Bomber Command would enable economic warfare
    to achieve what?
- answer: December 2007
  context: Governments have seen alternates between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and
    Indian National Congress (INC), no third front ever has become significant. In
    2003, the state legislative assembly was won by the Indian National Congress and
    Virbhadra Singh was elected as the chief minister of the state. In the assembly
    elections held in December 2007, the BJP secured a landslide victory. The BJP
    won 41 of the 68 seats while the Congress won only 23 of the 68 seats. BJP's Prem
    Kumar Dhumal was sworn in as Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh on 30 December
    2007.
  question: When did the BJP secure a landslide victory?
- answer: Christianity
  context: In 1920 French Equatorial Africa was established and Ubangi-Shari was administered
    from Brazzaville. During the 1920s and 1930s the French introduced a policy of
    mandatory cotton cultivation, a network of roads was built, attempts were made
    to combat sleeping sickness and Protestant missions were established to spread
    Christianity. New forms of forced labor were also introduced and a large number
    of Ubangians were sent to work on the Congo-Ocean Railway. Many of these forced
    laborers died of exhaustion, illness, or the poor conditions which claimed between
    20% and 25% of the 127,000 workers.
  question: What religion was spread through CAR?
- answer: the critic employs conjecture at every step of the process
  context: The stemmatic method's final step is emendatio, also sometimes referred
    to as "conjectural emendation." But in fact, the critic employs conjecture at
    every step of the process. Some of the method's rules that are designed to reduce
    the exercise of editorial judgment do not necessarily produce the correct result.
    For example, where there are more than two witnesses at the same level of the
    tree, normally the critic will select the dominant reading. However, it may be
    no more than fortuitous that more witnesses have survived that present a particular
    reading. A plausible reading that occurs less often may, nevertheless, be the
    correct one.
  question: At what point can a critic using the stemmatic become less concerned with
    critical analysis?
- answer: 7th
  context: Legendary Princess Bhrikuti (7th-century) and artist Araniko (1245 - 1306
    AD) from that tradition of Kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading
    Buddhism in Tibet and China. There are over 108 traditional monasteries (Bahals
    and Bahis) in Kathmandu based on Newar Buddhism. Since the 1960s, the permanent
    Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so that there
    are now over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area. Also, with the modernization
    of Newar Buddhism, various Theravada Bihars have been established.
  question: In what century was Bhrikuti said to live?
- answer: River Danube
  context: The earliest mentions of Slavic raids across the lower River Danube may
    be dated to the first half of the 6th century, yet no archaeological evidence
    of a Slavic settlement in the Balkans could be securely dated before c. 600 AD.
  question: The earliest mentions of Slavic raids are across what river?
- answer: by neutral molecular evolution
  context: The relationship between genes can be measured by comparing the sequence
    alignment of their DNA.:7.6 The degree of sequence similarity between homologous
    genes is called conserved sequence. Most changes to a gene's sequence do not affect
    its function and so genes accumulate mutations over time by neutral molecular
    evolution. Additionally, any selection on a gene will cause its sequence to diverge
    at a different rate. Genes under stabilizing selection are constrained and so
    change more slowly whereas genes under directional selection change sequence more
    rapidly. The sequence differences between genes can be used for phylogenetic analyses
    to study how those genes have evolved and how the organisms they come from are
    related.
  question: How do genes typically accumulate mutations over time?
- answer: James Gleick
  context: 'In a 1992 New York Times article on Feynman and his legacy, James Gleick
    recounts the story of how Murray Gell-Mann described what has become known as
    "The Feynman Algorithm" or "The Feynman Problem-Solving Algorithm" to a student:
    "The student asks Gell-Mann about Feynman''s notes. Gell-Mann says no, Dick''s
    methods are not the same as the methods used here. The student asks, well, what
    are Feynman''s methods? Gell-Mann leans coyly against the blackboard and says:
    Dick''s method is this. You write down the problem. You think very hard. (He shuts
    his eyes and presses his knuckles parodically to his forehead.) Then you write
    down the answer."'
  question: Who helped tell the 1992 New York Times story about Feynman?
- answer: perform rituals
  context: In 1725 Yongzheng bestowed the hereditary title of Marquis on a descendant
    of the Ming dynasty Imperial family, Zhu Zhiliang, who received a salary from
    the Qing government and whose duty was to perform rituals at the Ming tombs, and
    was also inducted the Chinese Plain White Banner in the Eight Banners. Later the
    Qianlong Emperor bestowed the title Marquis of Extended Grace posthumously on
    Zhu Zhuliang in 1750, and the title passed on through twelve generations of Ming
    descendants until the end of the Qing dynasty.
  question: What was Zhu's job?
- answer: zonen
  context: "Vowel length is not always considered a distinctive feature in Dutch phonology,\
    \ because it normally co-occurs with changes in vowel quality. One feature or\
    \ the other may be considered redundant, and some phonemic analyses prefer to\
    \ treat it as an opposition of tenseness. However, even if not considered part\
    \ of the phonemic opposition, the long/tense vowels are still realised as phonetically\
    \ longer than their short counterparts. The changes in vowel quality are also\
    \ not always the same in all dialects, and in some there may be little difference\
    \ at all, with length remaining the primary distinguishing feature. And while\
    \ it is true that older words always pair vowel length with a change in vowel\
    \ quality, new loanwords have reintroduced phonemic oppositions of length. Compare\
    \ zonne(n) [\u02C8z\u0254n\u0259] (\"suns\") versus zone [\u02C8z\u0254\u02D0\
    n\u0259] (\"zone\") versus zonen [\u02C8zo\u02D0n\u0259(n)] (\"sons\"), or kroes\
    \ [krus] (\"mug\") versus cruise [kru\u02D0s] (\"cruise\")."
  question: How would you say "sons" in Dutch?
- answer: '1998'
  context: Until 1998, the network carried a variety of American programs in addition
    to its core Canadian programming, directly competing with private Canadian broadcasters
    such as CTV and Global. Since then, it has restricted itself to Canadian programs,
    a handful of British programs, and a few American movies and off-network repeats.
    Since this change, the CBC has sometimes struggled to maintain ratings comparable
    to those it achieved before 1995, although it has seen somewhat of a ratings resurgence
    in recent years. In the 2007-08 season, hit series such as Little Mosque on the
    Prairie and The Border helped the network achieve its strongest ratings performance
    in over half a decade.
  question: In what year did the network end American programming?
- answer: Battle of Krtsanisi
  context: "Another civil war ensued after the death of Karim Khan in 1779, out of\
    \ which Aqa Mohammad Khan emerged, founding the Qajar Dynasty in 1794. In 1795,\
    \ following the disobedience of the Georgian subjects and their alliance with\
    \ the Russians, the Qajars captured Tblisi by the Battle of Krtsanisi, and drove\
    \ the Russians out of the entire Caucasus, reestablishing a short-lived Iranian\
    \ suzerainty over the region. The Russo-Persian wars of 1804\u20131813 and 1826\u2013\
    1828 resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for Iran in the Caucasus,\
    \ comprising all of Transcaucasia and Dagestan, which made part of the very concept\
    \ of Iran for centuries, and thus substantial gains for the neighboring Russian\
    \ Empire."
  question: The Qajars defeated the Russians at what battle to take over Tblisi?
- answer: secondary education
  context: Community Training Centres (CTCs) have been established within the primary
    schools on each atoll. The CTCs provide vocational training to students who do
    not progress beyond Class 8 because they failed the entry qualifications for secondary
    education. The CTCs offer training in basic carpentry, gardening and farming,
    sewing and cooking. At the end of their studies the graduates can apply to continue
    studies either at Motufoua Secondary School or the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute
    (TMTI). Adults can also attend courses at the CTCs.
  question: For what have CTC students failed to qualify ?
- answer: adjustments in taxation and expenditure in the economies
  context: On the other hand, certain financial techniques can reduce the impact of
    such purchases on the currency. One is sterilisation, in which highly valued assets
    are sold at the same time that the weaker assets are purchased, which keeps the
    money supply neutral. Another technique is simply to accept the bad assets as
    long-term collateral (as opposed to short-term repo swaps) to be held until their
    market value stabilises. This would imply, as a quid pro quo, adjustments in taxation
    and expenditure in the economies of the weaker states to improve the perceived
    value of the assets.
  question: How can weaker states improve the surface value of their assets?
- answer: the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham
  context: Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. On 20 June
    1837, William IV died at the age of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United
    Kingdom. In her diary she wrote, "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told
    me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see
    me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my dressing gown)
    and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle,
    the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and
    consequently that I am Queen." Official documents prepared on the first day of
    her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn
    at her own wish and not used again.
  question: Who informed Victoria of her Uncle's passing and that she was now to become
    Queen of England?
- answer: 2800 BC
  context: "Copper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the\
    \ oldest civilizations on record. It has a history of use that is at least 10,000\
    \ years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle\
    \ East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. There\
    \ is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only\
    \ metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought\
    \ to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2)\
    \ annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia,\
    \ all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously\
    \ at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was\
    \ independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented\
    \ locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently\
    \ in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West\
    \ Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in\
    \ 4500\u20134000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining\
    \ at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. \xD6tzi the Iceman, a male\
    \ dated from 3300\u20133200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7%\
    \ pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting.\
    \ Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular,\
    \ copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old\
    \ Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC.\
    \ Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and\
    \ (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.[citation\
    \ needed]"
  question: When was copper thought to have been discovered in China?
- answer: Thomas Leverton Donaldson
  context: "The design of the Institute's Mycenean lions medal and the motto \u2018\
    Usui civium, decori urbium' has been attributed to Thomas Leverton Donaldson,\
    \ who had been honorary secretary until 1839. The RIBA Guide to its Archive and\
    \ History (Angela Mace,1986) records that the first official version of this badge\
    \ was used as a bookplate for the Institute's library and publications from 1835\
    \ to 1891, when it was redesigned by J.H.Metcalfe. It was again redesigned in\
    \ 1931 by Eric Gill and in 1960 by Joan Hassall. The description in the 1837 by-laws\
    \ was: \"gules, two lions rampant guardant or, supporting a column marked with\
    \ lines chevron, proper, all standing on a base of the same; a garter surrounding\
    \ the whole with the inscription Institute of British Architects, anno salutis\
    \ MDCCCXXXIV; above a mural crown proper, and beneath the motto Usui civium decori\
    \ urbium \"."
  question: Who is responsible for the use of 'usui civium decori urbium'?
- answer: I Walk the Line
  context: Chris Daughtry's performance of Fuel's "Hemorrhage (In My Hands)" on the
    show was widely praised and led to an invitation to join the band as Fuel's new
    lead singer, an invitation he declined. His performance of Live's version of "I
    Walk the Line" was well received by the judges but later criticized in some quarters
    for not crediting the arrangement to Live. He was eliminated at the top four in
    a shocking result.
  question: Which song performance did he receive both praise and criticism for?
- answer: Bruce Voeller
  context: Depending on which component of sexual orientation is being assessed and
    referenced, different conclusions can be drawn about the prevalence rate of homosexuality
    which has real world consequences. Knowing how much of the population is made
    up of homosexual individuals influences how this population may be seen or treated
    by the public and government bodies. For example, if homosexual individuals constitute
    only 1% of the general population they are politically easier to ignore or than
    if they are known to be a constituency that surpasses most ethnic and ad minority
    groups. If the number is relatively minor then it is difficult to argue for community
    based same sex programs and services, mass media inclusion of gay role models,
    or Gay/Straight Alliances in schools. For this reason, in the 1970s Bruce Voeller,
    the chair of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force perpetuated a common myth
    that the prevalence of homosexuality is 10% for the whole population by averaging
    a 13% number for men and a 7% number for women. Voeller generalized this finding
    and used it as part of the modern gay rights movement to convince politicians
    and the public that "we [gays and lesbians] are everywhere".
  question: Who was the cahir of the national gay and lesbian task force in the 1970s?
- answer: a series of state-owned heavy industries
  context: "In the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested\
    \ heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part\
    \ of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy\
    \ industry production centre of East China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201C\
    world-class\u201D industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes\
    \ during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for\
    \ non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s.\
    \ From 1960s to 1980s there were Five Pillar Industries, namely, electronics,\
    \ cars, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms.\
    \ After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises\
    \ found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and\
    \ local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy\
    \ or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of layoff workers who were\
    \ technically not unemployed but effectively jobless."
  question: What did the government build in Nanjing during the 1950's?
- answer: African elephant
  context: Hellenistic warfare was a continuation of the military developments of
    Iphicrates and Philip II of Macedon, particularly his use of the Macedonian Phalanx,
    a dense formation of pikemen, in conjunction with heavy companion cavalry. Armies
    of the Hellenistic period differed from those of the classical period in being
    largely made up of professional soldiers and also in their greater specialization
    and technical proficiency in siege warfare. Hellenistic armies were significantly
    larger than those of classical Greece relying increasingly on Greek mercenaries
    (misthophoroi; men-for-pay) and also on non-Greek soldiery such as Thracians,
    Galatians, Egyptians and Iranians. Some ethnic groups were known for their martial
    skill in a particular mode of combat and were highly sought after, including Tarantine
    cavalry, Cretan archers, Rhodian slingers and Thracian peltasts. This period also
    saw the adoption of new weapons and troop types such as Thureophoroi and the Thorakitai
    who used the oval Thureos shield and fought with javelins and the machaira sword.
    The use of heavily armored cataphracts and also horse archers was adopted by the
    Seleucids, Greco-Bactrians, Armenians and Pontus. The use of war elephants also
    became common. Seleucus received Indian war elephants from the Mauryan empire,
    and used them to good effect at the battle of Ipsus. He kept a core of 500 of
    them at Apameia. The Ptolemies used the smaller African elephant.
  question: What kind of elephant did the Ptolemies use?
- answer: 420,000
  context: Strong aftershocks continued to strike even months after the main quake.
    On May 25, an aftershock of 6.0 Mw (6.4 Ms according to CEA) hit northeast of
    the original earthquake's epicenter, in Qingchuan County, Sichuan, causing eight
    deaths, 1000 injuries, and destroying thousands of buildings. On May 27, two aftershocks,
    one 5.2 Mw in Qingchuan County and one 5.7 Mw in Ningqiang County, Shaanxi, led
    to the collapse of more than 420,000 homes and injured 63 people. The same area
    suffered two more aftershocks of 5.6 and 6.0 Ms (5.8 and 5.5 Mw, respectively,
    according to USGS) on July 23, resulting in 1 death, 6 serious injuries, collapse
    of hundreds of homes and damaging kilometers of highways. Pingwu County and Beichuan
    County, Sichuan, also northeast of Wenchuan and close to the epicenter of a 7.2
    Ms earthquake in 1976, suffered a 6.1 Ms aftershock (5.7 Mw according to USGS)
    on August 1; it caused 2 deaths, 345 injuries, collapse of 707 homes, damages
    to over 1,000 homes, and blocked 25 kilometres (16 mi) of country roads. As late
    as August 5, yet another aftershock of 6.1 Ms (6.2 Mw according to USGS) hit Qingchuan,
    Sichuan, causing 1 death, 32 injuries, telecommunication interruptions, and widespread
    hill slides blocking roads in the area including a national highway.
  question: How many buildings collapsed as a result of the May 27th aftershocks?
- answer: Frank Stilwell
  context: From 1877 to 1878, the area suffered a rash of stagecoach robberies. Most
    notable, however, were the two holdups committed by masked road-agent William
    Whitney Brazelton. Brazelton held up two stages in the summer of 1878 near Point
    of Mountain Station approximately 17 mi (27 km) northwest of Tucson. John Clum,
    of Tombstone, Arizona fame was one of the passengers. Brazelton was eventually
    tracked down and killed on Monday August 19, 1878, in a mesquite bosque along
    the Santa Cruz River 3 miles (5 km) south of Tucson by Pima County Sheriff Charles
    A. Shibell and his citizen's posse. Brazelton had been suspected of highway robbery
    not only in the Tucson area, but also in the Prescott region and Silver City,
    New Mexico area as well. Brazelton's crimes prompted John J. Valentine, Sr. of
    Wells, Fargo & Co. to send special agent and future Pima County sheriff Bob Paul
    to investigate. Fort Lowell, then east of Tucson, was established to help protect
    settlers from Apache attacks. In 1882, Frank Stilwell was implicated in the murder
    of Morgan Earp by Cowboy Pete Spence's wife, Marietta, at the coroner's inquest
    on Morgan Earp's shooting. The coroner's jury concluded that Spence, Stilwell,
    Frederick Bode, and Florentino "Indian Charlie" Cruz were the prime suspects in
    the assassination of Morgan Earp. :250 Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp gathered
    a few trusted friends and accompanied Virgil Earp and his family as they traveled
    to Benson for a train ride to California. They found Stilwell lying in wait for
    Virgil in the Tucson station and killed him on the tracks. After killing Stilwell,
    Wyatt deputized others and rode on a vendetta, killing three more cowboys over
    the next few days before leaving the state.
  question: Who was held responsible for the murder of Morgan Earp?
- answer: "Tun Shein \u2014 a leading politician of the 1910s, who campaigned for\
    \ Burmese independence in London."
  context: "Myanmar's first film was a documentary of the funeral of Tun Shein \u2014\
    \ a leading politician of the 1910s, who campaigned for Burmese independence in\
    \ London. The first Burmese silent film Myitta Ne Thuya (Love and Liquor) in 1920\
    \ which proved a major success, despite its poor quality due to a fixed camera\
    \ position and inadequate film accessories. During the 1920s and 1930s, many Burmese-owned\
    \ film companies made and produced several films. The first Burmese sound film\
    \ was produced in 1932 in Bombay, India with the title Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya (Money\
    \ Can't Buy It). After World War II, Burmese cinema continued to address political\
    \ themes. Many of the films produced in the early Cold War era had a strong propaganda\
    \ element to them."
  question: Why was this film relevant enough to be the first ?
- answer: the encirclement of the town by the Prussians
  context: The first action of the Franco-Prussian War took place on 4 August 1870.
    This battle saw the unsupported division of General Douay of I Corps, with some
    attached cavalry, which was posted to watch the border, attacked in overwhelming
    but uncoordinated fashion by the German 3rd Army. During the day, elements of
    a Bavarian and two Prussian corps became engaged and were aided by Prussian artillery,
    which blasted holes in the defenses of the town. Douay held a very strong position
    initially, thanks to the accurate long-range fire of the Chassepots but his force
    was too thinly stretched to hold it. Douay was killed in the late morning when
    a caisson of the divisional mitrailleuse battery exploded near him; the encirclement
    of the town by the Prussians threatened the French avenue of retreat.
  question: What threatened the French avenue of retreat?
- answer: Zang
  context: "The modern Standard Chinese exonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu\
    \ (Chinese: \u85CF\u533A; pinyin: Z\xE0ngq\u016B), which derives by metonymy from\
    \ the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, \u533A\
    \ q\u016B, which means \"area, district, region, ward\". Tibetan people, language,\
    \ and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese:\
    \ \u85CF; pinyin: Z\xE0ng) although the geographical term X\u012Bz\xE0ng is often\
    \ limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term X\u012Bz\xE0ng was coined during\
    \ the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796\u20131820) through\
    \ the addition of a prefix meaning \"west\" (\u897F x\u012B) to Zang."
  question: How do the Chinese refer to Tibetan people, language, and culture?
- answer: letterboxing or anamorphic stretching
  context: At a minimum, HDTV has twice the linear resolution of standard-definition
    television (SDTV), thus showing greater detail than either analog television or
    regular DVD. The technical standards for broadcasting HDTV also handle the 16:9
    aspect ratio images without using letterboxing or anamorphic stretching, thus
    increasing the effective image resolution.
  question: HDTV increases the effective image resolution by not using what?
- answer: Lisbon
  context: "Tourist hotspots in Portugal are Lisbon, Algarve, Madeira, Porto and the\
    \ city of Coimbra, also, between 4-5 million religious pilgrims visit F\xE1tima\
    \ each year, where apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary to three shepherd children\
    \ reportedly took place in 1917. The Sanctuary of F\xE1tima is one of the largest\
    \ Roman Catholic shrines in the world. The Portuguese government continues to\

  question: What do groups in Mindelo challenge each other for?
- answer: Fort Lewis
  context: Eisenhower returned to the U.S. in December 1939 and was assigned as a
    battalion commander and regimental executive officer of the 15th Infantry at Fort
    Lewis, Washington. In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief
    of staff of the newly activated IX Corps under Major General Kenyon Joyce. In
    June 1941, he was appointed Chief of Staff to General Walter Krueger, Commander
    of the 3rd Army, at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. After successfully
    participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers, he was promoted to brigadier general
    on October 3, 1941. Although his administrative abilities had been noticed, on
    the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II he had never held an active command
    above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander
    of major operations.
  question: At what military installation was the 15th Infantry based?
- answer: Edwin Hubble
  context: "The beginning of the 20th century brought the start of a revolution in\
    \ physics. The long-held theories of Newton were shown not to be correct in all\
    \ circumstances. Beginning in 1900, Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and\
    \ others developed quantum theories to explain various anomalous experimental\
    \ results, by introducing discrete energy levels. Not only did quantum mechanics\
    \ show that the laws of motion did not hold on small scales, but even more disturbingly,\
    \ the theory of general relativity, proposed by Einstein in 1915, showed that\
    \ the fixed background of spacetime, on which both Newtonian mechanics and special\
    \ relativity depended, could not exist. In 1925, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schr\xF6\
    dinger formulated quantum mechanics, which explained the preceding quantum theories.\
    \ The observation by Edwin Hubble in 1929 that the speed at which galaxies recede\
    \ positively correlates with their distance, led to the understanding that the\
    \ universe is expanding, and the formulation of the Big Bang theory by Georges\
    \ Lema\xEEtre."
  question: Which scientist noticed the relationship between the speed and distance
    of galaxies?
- answer: St George's Cross
  context: "From the period of 1600, the canton consisted of a St George's Cross representing\
    \ the Kingdom of England. With the Acts of Union 1707, the canton was updated\
    \ to be the new Union Flag\u2014consisting of an English St George's Cross combined\
    \ with a Scottish St Andrew's cross\u2014representing the Kingdom of Great Britain.\
    \ After the Acts of Union 1800 that joined Ireland with Great Britain to form\
    \ the United Kingdom, the canton of the East India Company flag was altered accordingly\
    \ to include a Saint Patrick's Saltire replicating the updated Union Flag representing\
    \ the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland."
  question: in the period of  1600 what Canton cross repesented England
- answer: eat from multiple levels of the food chain
  context: Many organisms (of which humans are prime examples) eat from multiple levels
    of the food chain and, thus, make this classification problematic. A carnivore
    may eat both secondary and tertiary consumers, and its prey may itself be difficult
    to classify for similar reasons. Organisms showing both carnivory and herbivory
    are known as omnivores. Even herbivores such as the giant panda may supplement
    their diet with meat. Scavenging of carrion provides a significant part of the
    diet of some of the most fearsome predators. Carnivorous plants would be very
    difficult to fit into this classification, producing their own food but also digesting
    anything that they may trap. Organisms that eat detritivores or parasites would
    also be difficult to classify by such a scheme.
  question: Why are species can be difficult to classify because they?
- answer: statistical mechanics
  context: But in statistical mechanics things get more complicated. On one hand,
    statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics, in that thermodynamic
    behavior, such as glass breaking, can be explained by the fundamental laws of
    physics paired with a statistical postulate. But statistical mechanics, unlike
    classical thermodynamics, is time-reversal symmetric. The second law of thermodynamics,
    as it arises in statistical mechanics, merely states that it is overwhelmingly
    likely that net entropy will increase, but it is not an absolute law.
  question: What are superior to classical thermodynamics?
- answer: Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George
    III
  context: Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn,
    the fourth son of King George III. Both the Duke of Kent and King George III died
    in 1820, and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German-born mother
    Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She inherited the throne aged 18, after
    her father's three elder brothers had all died, leaving no surviving legitimate
    children. The United Kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy,
    in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power. Privately,
    Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments;
    publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards
    of personal morality.
  question: Who was Victoria's father?
- answer: motor could be changed using slip rings
  context: "The first attempts to use standard-frequency single-phase AC were made\
    \ in Hungary as far back as 1923, by the Hungarian K\xE1lm\xE1n Kand\xF3 on the\
    \ line between Budapest-Nyugati and Alag, using 16 kV at 50 Hz. The locomotives\
    \ carried a four-pole rotating phase converter feeding a single traction motor\
    \ of the polyphase induction type at 600 to 1,100 V. The number of poles on the\
    \ 2,500 hp motor could be changed using slip rings to run at one of four synchronous\
    \ speeds. The tests were a success so, from 1932 until the 1960s, trains on the\
    \ Budapest-Hegyeshalom line (towards Vienna) regularly used the same system. A\
    \ few decades after the Second World War, the 16 kV was changed to the Russian\
    \ and later French 25 kV system."
  question: How could the locomotives run on four speed levels?
- answer: noble gases
  context: Uranium metal reacts with almost all non-metal elements (with an exception
    of the noble gases) and their compounds, with reactivity increasing with temperature.
    Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other
    than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly. When finely divided, it
    can react with cold water; in air, uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer
    of uranium oxide. Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium
    dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry.
  question: What non-metal elements does uranium notably not react to?
- answer: Swindon station pub
  context: Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the British engineer and railway builder, introduced
    the idea of a circular bar into the Swindon station pub in order that customers
    were served quickly and did not delay his trains. These island bars became popular
    as they also allowed staff to serve customers in several different rooms surrounding
    the bar.
  question: At what establishment was the circular bar introduced?
- answer: Miami Beach and the Bahamas
  context: Like many older east coast cities after World War II, Atlantic City became
    plagued with poverty, crime, corruption, and general economic decline in the mid-to-late
    20th century. The neighborhood known as the "Inlet" became particularly impoverished.
    The reasons for the resort's decline were multi-layered. First of all, the automobile
    became more readily available to many Americans after the war. Atlantic City had
    initially relied upon visitors coming by train and staying for a couple of weeks.
    The car allowed them to come and go as they pleased, and many people would spend
    only a few days, rather than weeks. Also, the advent of suburbia played a huge
    role. With many families moving to their own private houses, luxuries such as
    home air conditioning and swimming pools diminished their interest in flocking
    to the luxury beach resorts during the hot summer. But perhaps the biggest factor
    in the decline in Atlantic City's popularity came from cheap, fast jet service
    to other premier resorts, such as Miami Beach and the Bahamas.
  question: What were two other locations people began to fly to instead of going
    to Atlantic City?
- answer: tuberculin
  context: The bacillus causing tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis, was identified and
    described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch. He received the Nobel Prize in physiology
    or medicine in 1905 for this discovery. Koch did not believe the bovine (cattle)
    and human tuberculosis diseases were similar, which delayed the recognition of
    infected milk as a source of infection. Later, the risk of transmission from this
    source was dramatically reduced by the invention of the pasteurization process.
    Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a "remedy" for tuberculosis
    in 1890, calling it "tuberculin". While it was not effective, it was later successfully
    adapted as a screening test for the presence of pre-symptomatic tuberculosis.
    The World Tuberculosis Day was established on 24 March for this reason.
  question: What did Koch call the ineffective treatment for TB he came up with in
    1890?
- answer: speed
  context: Large brushes are desired for a larger brush contact area to maximize motor
    output, but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize the speed at which
    the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking. (Small
    brushes are also desirable for lower cost.) Stiffer brush springs can also be
    used to make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed, but at the cost of
    greater friction losses (lower efficiency) and accelerated brush and commutator
    wear. Therefore, DC motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power,
    speed, and efficiency/wear.
  question: Whate are small brushes favorable for?
- answer: Beatrice
  context: In 1853, Victoria gave birth to her eighth child, Leopold, with the aid
    of the new anaesthetic, chloroform. Victoria was so impressed by the relief it
    gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of
    her ninth and final child, Beatrice, despite opposition from members of the clergy,
    who considered it against biblical teaching, and members of the medical profession,
    who thought it dangerous. Victoria may have suffered from post-natal depression
    after many of her pregnancies. Letters from Albert to Victoria intermittently
    complain of her loss of self-control. For example, about a month after Leopold's
    birth Albert complained in a letter to Victoria about her "continuance of hysterics"
    over a "miserable trifle".
  question: What was the name of Victoria's final child?
- answer: Hockey
  context: The New York Islanders and the New York Rangers represent the city in the
    National Hockey League. Also within the metropolitan area are the New Jersey Devils,
    who play in nearby Newark, New Jersey.
  question: What sport do the New York Rangers play?
- answer: New York, Illinois, and California are the most significant
  context: New York, Illinois, and California are the most significant states that
    have not adopted the FRCP. Furthermore, all three states continue to maintain
    most of their civil procedure laws in the form of codified statutes enacted by
    the state legislature, as opposed to court rules promulgated by the state supreme
    court, on the ground that the latter are undemocratic. But certain key portions
    of their civil procedure laws have been modified by their legislatures to bring
    them closer to federal civil procedure.
  question: Which states have not adopted FRCP?
- answer: local television advertising expenditures for the Hispanic market have increased
    much from 1999 to 2003, with growth of 58 percent and 43 percent, respectively.
  context: The State of the Union Addresses and other presidential speeches are translated
    to Spanish, following the precedent set by the Bill Clinton administration. Official
    Spanish translations are available at WhiteHouse.gov. Moreover, non-Hispanic American
    origin politicians fluent in Spanish-speak in Spanish to Hispanic majority constituencies.
    There are 500 Spanish newspapers, 152 magazines, and 205 publishers in the United
    States; magazine and local television advertising expenditures for the Hispanic
    market have increased much from 1999 to 2003, with growth of 58 percent and 43
    percent, respectively.
  question: Is the Hispanic population relevant to the American media?
- answer: western
  context: "The plains at the foot of the Sierra Madre Occidental is an elongated\
    \ mesa known as Altiplanicie Mexicana that exhibits a steppe climate and serves\
    \ as a transition zone from the mountain climate in the western part of the state\
    \ to the desert climate in the eastern side of the state. The steppe zone accounts\

    \ that often reach over 100 \xB0F in the summer and drop below 32 \xB0F in the\
    \ winter. The steppe zone is an important agriculture zone due to an extensive\
    \ development of canals exploiting several rivers that flow down from the mountains.\
    \ The steppe zone is the most populated area of the state."
  question: The mountain climate is found in which part of the state?
- answer: 28 June 1838
  context: "At the time of her accession, the government was led by the Whig prime\
    \ minister Lord Melbourne, who at once became a powerful influence on the politically\
    \ inexperienced Queen, who relied on him for advice. Charles Greville supposed\
    \ that the widowed and childless Melbourne was \"passionately fond of her as he\
    \ might be of his daughter if he had one\", and Victoria probably saw him as a\
    \ father figure. Her coronation took place on 28 June 1838 at Westminster Abbey.\
    \ Over 400,000 visitors came to London for the celebrations. She became the first\
    \ sovereign to take up residence at Buckingham Palace and inherited the revenues\
    \ of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall as well as being granted a civil list\
    \ allowance of \xA3385,000 per year. Financially prudent, she paid off her father's\
    \ debts."
  question: When was Victoria's coronation?
- answer: "\"R\xE4ndajad\" by Urban Symphony"
  context: "Estonia won the Eurovision Song Contest in 2001 with the song \"Everybody\"\
    \ performed by Tanel Padar and Dave Benton. In 2002, Estonia hosted the event.\
    \ Maarja-Liis Ilus has competed for Estonia on two occasions (1996 and 1997),\

    \ the first ever song in Estonian to chart in the UK, Belgium, and Switzerland."
  question: What was the first ever Estonian song to hit the popular European charts?
- answer: January 2011
  context: In June 2009, many of the world's largest mobile phone manufacturers signed
    an EC-sponsored Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), agreeing to make most data-enabled
    mobile phones marketed in the European Union compatible with a common External
    Power Supply (EPS). The EU's common EPS specification (EN 62684:2010) references
    the USB Battery Charging standard and is similar to the GSMA/OMTP and Chinese
    charging solutions. In January 2011, the International Electrotechnical Commission
    (IEC) released its version of the (EU's) common EPS standard as IEC 62684:2011.
  question: When did the IEC release its version of the common EPS standard as IEC
    62684:2011?

- answer: Minoru Yamasaki
  context: Architects such as Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Marcel Breuer
    worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials
    and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified
    geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the Industrial
    Revolution, including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise
    superstructures. By mid-century, Modernism had morphed into the International
    Style, an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the Twin Towers of New York's World
    Trade Center designed by Minoru Yamasaki.
  question: Who designed the Twin Towers?
- answer: landslides
  context: Persistent heavy rain and landslides in Wenchuan County and the nearby
    area badly affected rescue efforts. At the start of rescue operations on May 12,
    20 helicopters were deployed for the delivery of food, water, and emergency aid,
    and also the evacuation of the injured and reconnaissance of quake-stricken areas.
    By 17:37 CST on May 13, a total of over 15,600 troops and militia reservists from
    the Chengdu Military Region had joined the rescue force in the heavily affected
    areas. A commander reported from Yingxiu Town, Wenchuan, that around 3,000 survivors
    were found, while the status of the other inhabitants (around 9,000) remained
    unclear. The 1,300 rescuers reached the epicenter, and 300 pioneer troops reached
    the seat of Wenchuan at about 23:30 CST. By 12:17 CST, May 14, 2008, communication
    in the seat of Wenchuan was partly revived. On the afternoon of May 14, 15 Special
    Operations Troops, along with relief supplies and communications gear, parachuted
    into inaccessible Mao County, northeast of Wenchuan.
  question: What natural disasters were occurring in Wenchuan County?
- answer: By 1879 one of the delegates to the California constitutional convention
    was already complaining
  context: 'Early on, American courts, even after the Revolution, often did cite contemporary
    English cases. This was because appellate decisions from many American courts
    were not regularly reported until the mid-19th century; lawyers and judges, as
    creatures of habit, used English legal materials to fill the gap. But citations
    to English decisions gradually disappeared during the 19th century as American
    courts developed their own principles to resolve the legal problems of the American
    people. The number of published volumes of American reports soared from eighteen
    in 1810 to over 8,000 by 1910. By 1879 one of the delegates to the California
    constitutional convention was already complaining: "Now, when we require them
    to state the reasons for a decision, we do not mean they shall write a hundred
    pages of detail. We [do] not mean that they shall include the small cases, and
    impose on the country all this fine judicial literature, for the Lord knows we
    have got enough of that already."'
  question: What did the lawmakers think of the increase in reports?
- answer: terraced houses
  context: In towns even most better-off people lived in terraced houses, which typically
    opened straight onto the street, often with a few steps up to the door. There
    was often an open space, protected by iron railings, dropping down to the basement
    level, with a discreet entrance down steps off the street for servants and deliveries;
    this is known as the "area". This meant that the ground floor front was now removed
    and protected from the street and encouraged the main reception rooms to move
    there from the floor above. Where, as often, a new street or set of streets was
    developed, the road and pavements were raised up, and the gardens or yards behind
    the houses at a lower level, usually representing the original one.
  question: Most town people lived in what type of houses?
- answer: the Napoleonic Wars
  context: "Federalism has a long tradition in German history. The Holy Roman Empire\
    \ comprised many petty states numbering more than 300 around 1796. The number\
    \ of territories was greatly reduced during the Napoleonic Wars (1796\u20131814).\
    \ After the Congress of Vienna (1815), 39 states formed the German Confederation.\
    \ The Confederation was dissolved after the Austro-Prussian War and replaced by\
    \ a North German Federation under Prussian hegemony; this war left Prussia dominant\
    \ in Germany, and German nationalism would compel the remaining independent states\
    \ to ally with Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371, and then to\
    \ accede to the crowning of King Wilhelm of Prussia as German Emperor. The new\
    \ German Empire included 25 states (three of them, Hanseatic cities) and the imperial\
    \ territory of Alsace-Lorraine. The empire was dominated by Prussia, which controlled\
    \ 65% of the territory and 62% of the population. After the territorial losses\
    \ of the Treaty of Versailles, the remaining states continued as republics of\
    \ a new German federation. These states were gradually de facto abolished and\
    \ reduced to provinces under the Nazi regime via the Gleichschaltung process,\
    \ as the states administratively were largely superseded by the Nazi Gau system."
  question: The number of territories was greatly reduced during what?
- answer: Roanoke
  context: Richmond emerged a decade after the smoldering rubble of the Civil War
    to resume its position as an economic powerhouse, with iron front buildings and
    massive brick factories. Canal traffic peaked in the 1860s and slowly gave way
    to railroads, allowing Richmond to become a major railroad crossroads, eventually
    including the site of the world's first triple railroad crossing. Tobacco warehousing
    and processing continued to play a role, boosted by the world's first cigarette-rolling
    machine, invented by James Albert Bonsack of Roanoke in 1880/81. Contributing
    to Richmond's resurgence was the first successful electrically powered trolley
    system in the United States, the Richmond Union Passenger Railway. Designed by
    electric power pioneer Frank J. Sprague, the trolley system opened its first line
    in 1888, and electric streetcar lines rapidly spread to other cities across the
    country. Sprague's system used an overhead wire and trolley pole to collect current,
    with electric motors on the car's trucks. In Richmond, the transition from streetcars
    to buses began in May 1947 and was completed on November 25, 1949.
  question: From what city did James Bonsack originate?
- answer: firing squad
  context: Executions resumed on January 17, 1977, when Gary Gilmore went before a
    firing squad in Utah. But the pace was quite slow due to the use of litigation
    tactics which involved filing repeated writs of habeas corpus, which succeeded
    for many in delaying their actual execution for many years. Although hundreds
    of individuals were sentenced to death in the United States during the 1970s and
    early 1980s, only ten people besides Gilmore (who had waived all of his appeal
    rights) were actually executed prior to 1984.
  question: By what method was Gary Gilmore executed?
- answer: William Halfpenny
  context: "The period saw the growth of a distinct and trained architectural profession;\
    \ before the mid-century \"the high-sounding title, 'architect' was adopted by\
    \ anyone who could get away with it\". But most buildings were still designed\
    \ by builders and landlords together, and the wide spread of Georgian architecture,\
    \ and the Georgian styles of design more generally, came from dissemination through\
    \ pattern books and inexpensive suites of engravings. This contrasted with earlier\
    \ styles, which were primarily disseminated among craftsmen through the direct\
    \ experience of the apprenticeship system. Authors such as the prolific William\
    \ Halfpenny (active 1723\u20131755) received editions in America as well as Britain.\
    \ From the mid-18th century, Georgian styles were assimilated into an architectural\
    \ vernacular that became part and parcel of the training of every architect, designer,\
    \ builder, carpenter, mason and plasterer, from Edinburgh to Maryland."
  question: Which American author received editions of Georgian architecture?
- answer: entirely
  context: In contrast to the entirely digital DVD, LaserDiscs use only analog video.
    As the LaserDisc format is not digitally encoded and does not make use of compression
    techniques, it is immune to video macroblocking (most visible as blockiness during
    high motion sequences) or contrast banding (subtle visible lines in gradient areas,
    such as out-of-focus backgrounds, skies, or light casts from spotlights) that
    can be caused by the MPEG-2 encoding process as video is prepared for DVD. Early
    DVD releases held the potential to surpass their LaserDisc counterparts, but often
    managed only to match them for image quality, and in some cases, the LaserDisc
    version was preferred. However, proprietary human-assisted encoders manually operated
    by specialists can vastly reduce the incidence of artifacts, depending on playing
    time and image complexity. By the end of LaserDisc's run, DVDs were living up
    to their potential as a superior format.
  question: Are DVDs partially or entirely digital?
- answer: not always
  context: The major issue with the term Hellenistic lies in its convenience, as the
    spread of Greek culture was not the generalized phenomenon that the term implies.
    Some areas of the conquered world were more affected by Greek influences than
    others. The term Hellenistic also implies that the Greek populations were of majority
    in the areas in which they settled, while in many cases, the Greek settlers were
    actually the minority among the native populations. The Greek population and the
    native population did not always mix; the Greeks moved and brought their own culture,
    but interaction did not always occur.
  question: How often did Greek population and natives mix?
- answer: '''03 Bonnie & Clyde'
  context: "Beyonc\xE9 is believed to have first started a relationship with Jay Z\
    \ after a collaboration on \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\", which appeared on his seventh\
    \ album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002). Beyonc\xE9 appeared as Jay\
    \ Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, which would further fuel speculation\
    \ of their relationship. On April 4, 2008, Beyonc\xE9 and Jay Z were married without\
    \ publicity. As of April 2014, the couple have sold a combined 300 million records\
    \ together. The couple are known for their private relationship, although they\
    \ have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years. Beyonc\xE9 suffered a\
    \ miscarriage in 2010 or 2011, describing it as \"the saddest thing\" she had\
    \ ever endured. She returned to the studio and wrote music in order to cope with\
    \ the loss. In April 2011, Beyonc\xE9 and Jay Z traveled to Paris in order to\
    \ shoot the album cover for her 4, and unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris."
  question: "In which music video did Beyonc\xE9 star as Jay Z's girlfriend, creating\
    \ speculation about their relationship?"
- answer: Arab nationalist activism
  context: "Gaddafi organized demonstrations and distributed posters criticizing the\
    \ monarchy. In October 1961, he led a demonstration protesting Syria's secession\
    \ from the United Arab Republic. During this they broke windows of a local hotel\
    \ accused of serving alcohol. Catching the authorities' attention, they expelled\
    \ his family from Sabha. Gaddafi moved to Misrata, there attending Misrata Secondary\
    \ School. Maintaining his interest in Arab nationalist activism, he refused to\
    \ join any of the banned political parties active in the city \u2013 including\
    \ the Arab Nationalist Movement, the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, and the Muslim\
    \ Brotherhood \u2013 claiming he rejected factionalism. He read voraciously on\
    \ the subjects of Nasser and the French Revolution of 1789, as well as the works\
    \ of Syrian political theorist Michel Aflaq and biographies of Abraham Lincoln,\
    \ Sun Yat-sen, and Mustafa Kemal Atat\xFCrk."
  question: Where sort of activism did Gaddafi promote while attending secondary school?
- answer: April 1974
  context: "The Portuguese government and army successfully resisted the decolonization\
    \ of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military\
    \ coup in Lisbon, known as the Carnation Revolution, led the way for the independence\
    \ of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration\
    \ of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (Processo\
    \ Revolucion\xE1rio Em Curso). This period was characterized by social turmoil\
    \ and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. The retreat\
    \ from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by\
    \ Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create\
    \ independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from\
    \ Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese Angola and Mozambique)."
  question: Until when did the Portuguese government resist decolonization of their
    overseas territories?
- answer: rotor circuit
  context: In a WRIM, the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and
    is connected to slip rings on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control
    devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the
    motor speed, although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance.
    A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power
    that would otherwise be wasted back into the power system through an inverter
    or separate motor-generator.
  question: Where might a resistor be attached?
- answer: between plant cells
  context: Communication is observed within the plant organism, i.e. within plant
    cells and between plant cells, between plants of the same or related species,
    and between plants and non-plant organisms, especially in the root zone. Plant
    roots communicate with rhizome bacteria, fungi, and insects within the soil. These
    interactions are governed by syntactic, pragmatic, and semantic rules,[citation
    needed] and are possible because of the decentralized "nervous system" of plants.
    The original meaning of the word "neuron" in Greek is "vegetable fiber" and recent
    research has shown that most of the microorganism plant communication processes
    are neuron-like. Plants also communicate via volatiles when exposed to herbivory
    attack behavior, thus warning neighboring plants. In parallel they produce other
    volatiles to attract parasites which attack these herbivores. In stress situations
    plants can overwrite the genomes they inherited from their parents and revert
    to that of their grand- or great-grandparents.[citation needed]
  question: What is a form of communication observed within plants?
- answer: International Computer Music Conference
  context: An in-depth study of MP3 audio quality, sound artist and composer Ryan
    Maguire's project "The Ghost in the MP3" isolates the sounds lost during MP3 compression.
    In 2015, he released the track "moDernisT" (an anagram of "Tom's Diner"), composed
    exclusively from the sounds deleted during MP3 compression of the song "Tom's
    Diner", the track originally used in the formulation of the MP3 standard. A detailed
    account of the techniques used to isolate the sounds deleted during MP3 compression,
    along with the conceptual motivation for the project, was published in the 2014
    Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference.
  question: Where was an account of the study published?
- answer: enhance or maintain habitat of unlisted species which are declining and
    have the potential to become threatened or endangered
  context: The Candidate Conservation Agreement is closely related to the "Safe Harbor"
    agreement, the main difference is that the Candidate Conservation Agreements With
    Assurances(CCA) are meant to protect unlisted species by providing incentives
    to private landowners and land managing agencies to restore, enhance or maintain
    habitat of unlisted species which are declining and have the potential to become
    threatened or endangered if critical habitat is not protected. The FWS will then
    assure that if, in the future the unlisted species becomes listed, the landowner
    will not be required to do more than already agreed upon in the CCA.
  question: How does a CCA impact unlisted species?
- answer: Because the duchy was outside of the core Holy Roman Empire
  context: Because the duchy was outside of the core Holy Roman Empire, the prince-electors
    of Brandenburg were able to proclaim themselves King of Prussia beginning in 1701.
    After the annexation of most of western Royal Prussia in the First Partition of
    the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, eastern (ducal) Prussia was connected
    by land with the rest of the Prussian state and was reorganized as a province
    the following year (1773). Between 1829 and 1878, the Province of East Prussia
    was joined with West Prussia to form the Province of Prussia.
  question: Why were the prince electors able to proclaim themselves King of Prussia?
- answer: Hot Space
  context: In 1982, the band released the album Hot Space, a departure from their
    trademark seventies sound, this time being a mixture of rock, pop rock, dance,
    funk, and R&B. Most of the album was recorded in Munich during the most turbulent
    period in the band's history, and Taylor and May lamented the new sound, with
    both being very critical of the influence Mercury's personal manager Paul Prenter
    had on the singer. May was also scathing of Prenter, who was Mercury's manager
    from the early 1980s to 1984, for being dismissive of the importance of radio
    stations, such as the US networks, and their vital connection between the artist
    and the community, and for denying them access to Mercury. The band stopped touring
    North America after their Hot Space Tour, as their success there had waned, although
    they would perform on American television for the only time during the eighth
    season premiere of Saturday Night Live. Queen left Elektra Records, their label
    in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, and signed onto
    EMI/Capitol Records.
  question: What album did Queen release in 1982?
- answer: Lawrence M. Krauss and Sam Harris
  context: Some findings in the fields of cosmology, evolutionary biology and neuroscience
    are interpreted by atheists (including Lawrence M. Krauss and Sam Harris) as evidence
    that God is an imaginary entity only, with no basis in reality. A single, omniscient
    God who is imagined to have created the universe and is particularly attentive
    to the lives of humans has been imagined, embellished and promulgated in a trans-generational
    manner. Richard Dawkins interprets various findings not only as a lack of evidence
    for the material existence of such a God but extensive evidence to the contrary.
  question: Who believes God isn't real?
- answer: Chairman Mao Tse-Tung
  context: "In China, red (simplified Chinese: \u7EA2; traditional Chinese: \u7D05\
    ; pinyin: h\xF3ng) is the symbol of fire and the south (both south in general\
    \ and Southern China specifically). It carries a largely positive connotation,\
    \ being associated with courage, loyalty, honor, success, fortune, fertility,\
    \ happiness, passion, and summer. In Chinese cultural traditions, red is associated\
    \ with weddings (where brides traditionally wear red dresses) and red paper is\
    \ frequently used to wrap gifts of money or other objects. Special red packets\
    \ (simplified Chinese: \u7EA2\u5305; traditional Chinese: \u7D05\u5305; pinyin:\
    \ h\xF3ng b\u0101o in Mandarin or lai see in Cantonese) are specifically used\
    \ during Chinese New Year celebrations for giving monetary gifts. On the more\
    \ negative side, obituaries are traditionally written in red ink, and to write\
    \ someone's name in red signals either cutting them out of one's life, or that\
    \ they have died. Red is also associated with either the feminine or the masculine\
    \ (yin and yang respectively), depending on the source. The Little Red Book, a\
    \ collection of quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung, founding father of the\
    \ People's Republic of China (PRC), was published in 1966 and widely distributed\
    \ thereafter."
  question: Who wrote the Little Red Book?
- answer: On the Road
  context: "Near the intersection of Craycroft and Ft. Lowell Roads are the remnants\
    \ of the Historic Fort Lowell. This area has become one of Tucson's iconic neighborhoods.\
    \ In 1891, the Fort was abandoned and much of the interior was stripped of their\
    \ useful components and it quickly fell into ruin. In 1900, three of the officer\
    \ buildings were purchased for use as a sanitarium. The sanitarium was then sold\
    \ to Harvey Adkins in 1928. The Bolsius family Pete, Nan and Charles Bolsius purchased\
    \ and renovated surviving adobe buildings of the Fort \u2013 transforming them\
    \ into spectacular artistic southwestern architectural examples. Their woodwork,\
    \ plaster treatment and sense of proportion drew on their Dutch heritage and New\
    \ Mexican experience. Other artists and academics throughout the middle of the\
    \ 20th century, including: Win Ellis, Jack Maul, Madame Cheruy, Giorgio Belloli,\
    \ Charels Bode, Veronica Hughart, Edward and Rosamond Spicer, Hazel Larson Archer\
    \ and Ruth Brown, renovated adobes, built homes and lived in the area. The artist\
    \ colony attracted writers and poets including beat generation Alan Harrington\
    \ and Jack Kerouac whose visit is documented in his iconic book On the Road. This\
    \ rural pocket in the middle of the city is listed on the National Register of\
    \ Historic Places. Each year in February the neighborhood celebrates its history\
    \ in the City Landmark it owns and restored the San Pedro Chapel."
  question: In what book did Jack Kerouac write about visiting Tucson?
- answer: diamagnetic nature of the ion
  context: "Zinc(I) compounds are rare, and require bulky ligands to stabilize the\
    \ low oxidation state. Most zinc(I) compounds contain formally the [Zn2]2+ core,\
    \ which is analogous to the [Hg2]2+ dimeric cation present in mercury(I) compounds.\
    \ The diamagnetic nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure. The first\
    \ zinc(I) compound containing the Zn\u2014Zn bond, (\u03B75-C5Me5)2Zn2, is also\
    \ the first dimetallocene. The [Zn2]2+ ion rapidly disproportionates into zinc\
    \ metal and zinc(II), and has only been obtained as a yellow glass formed by cooling\
    \ a solution of metallic zinc in molten ZnCl2."
  question: What confirms the dimeric structure of the compound?
- answer: MGM
  context: "In November 2013 MGM and the McClory estate formally settled the issue\
    \ with Danjaq, LLC\u2014sister company of Eon Productions\u2014with MGM acquiring\
    \ the full copyright film rights to the concept of Spectre and all of the characters\
    \ associated with it. With the acquisition of the film rights and the organisation's\
    \ re-introduction to the series' continuity, the SPECTRE acronym was discarded\
    \ and the organisation reimagined as \"Spectre\"."
  question: Who ended up with ownership of Spectre?
- answer: '247'
  context: Initially the change in strategy caught the RAF off-guard, and caused extensive
    damage and civilian casualties. Some 107,400 long tons (109,100 t) of shipping
    was damaged in the Thames Estuary and 1,600 civilians were casualties. Of this
    total around 400 were killed. The fighting in the air was more intense in daylight.
    Overall Loge had cost the Luftwaffe 41 aircraft; 14 bombers, 16 Messerschmitt
    Bf 109s, seven Messerschmitt Bf 110s and four reconnaissance aircraft. Fighter
    Command lost 23 fighters, with six pilots killed and another seven wounded. Another
    247 bombers from Sperrle's Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3) attacked that night. On
    8 September, the Luftwaffe returned. This time 412 people were killed and 747
    severely wounded.
  question: How many Air Fleet 3 attacked that night?
- answer: Romantic
  context: The music of the Romantic era, from roughly the first decade of the 19th
    century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to
    an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling
    romanticism in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical
    era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like nocturnes,
    fantasias, and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition
    and development of themes were ignored or minimized. The music became more chromatic,
    dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms
    of the older forms) about key signatures increasing. The art song (or Lied) came

  context: Catholicism arrived 400 years ago in the province and Protestantism 150
    years ago. Zhejiang is one of the provinces of China with the largest concentrations
    of Protestants, especially notable in the city of Wenzhou. In 1999 Zhejiang's
    Protestant population comprised 2.8% of the provincial population, a small percentage
    but higher than the national average.
  question: What percent of Zhejiang was Protestant in 1999?
- answer: Clayton Holdings
  context: "In separate testimony to Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, officers\
    \ of Clayton Holdings\u2014the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization\
    \ surveillance company in the United States and Europe\u2014testified that Clayton's\
    \ review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from January 2006 to June 2007 revealed\
    \ that scarcely 54% of the loans met their originators\u2019 underwriting standards.\
    \ The analysis (conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks, including\
    \ 7 \"too big to fail\" banks) additionally showed that 28% of the sampled loans\
    \ did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer. Clayton's analysis further\
    \ showed that 39% of these loans (i.e. those not meeting any issuer's minimal\
    \ underwriting standards) were subsequently securitized and sold to investors."
  question: Who was the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization
    surveillance company?
- answer: in almost every geographic area
  context: Political science is a late arrival in terms of social sciences[citation
    needed]. However, the discipline has a clear set of antecedents such as moral
    philosophy, political philosophy, political economy, history, and other fields
    concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing
    the characteristics and functions of the ideal form of government. The roots of
    politics are in prehistory. In each historic period and in almost every geographic
    area, we can find someone studying politics and increasing political understanding.
  question: In history, where could you find someone studying politics?
- answer: Grade II*
  context: "Plymouth has the first known reference to Jews in the South West from\
    \ Sir Francis Drake's voyages in 1577 to 1580, as his log mentioned \"Moses the\
    \ Jew\" \u2013 a man from Plymouth. The Plymouth Synagogue is a Listed Grade II*\
    \ building, built in 1762 and is the oldest Ashkenazi Synagogue in the English\
    \ speaking world. There are also places of worship for Islam, Bah\xE1'\xED, Buddhism,\
    \ Unitarianism, Chinese beliefs and Humanism."
  question: What is Plymouth Synagogue's listed grade?
- answer: British power and supremacy
  context: 'The New Delhi town plan, like its architecture, was chosen with one single
    chief consideration: to be a symbol of British power and supremacy. All other
    decisions were subordinate to this, and it was this framework that dictated the
    choice and application of symbology and influences from both Hindu and Islamic
    architecture.'
  question: The New Delhi town plan was chosen primarily to symbolize what?
- answer: minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance
  context: These motors were originally invented to drive the capstan(s) of magnetic
    tape drives in the burgeoning computer industry, where minimal time to reach operating
    speed and minimal stopping distance were critical. Pancake motors are still widely
    used in high-performance servo-controlled systems, robotic systems, industrial
    automation and medical devices. Due to the variety of constructions now available,
    the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost
    pump and basic servos.
  question: What are advantages of pancake motors?
- answer: Federal District
  context: 'After years of demanding greater political autonomy, residents were given
    the right to directly elect a Head of Government and the representatives of the
    unicameral Legislative Assembly by popular vote in 1997. Ever since, the left-wing
    Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) has controlled both of them. In recent
    years, the local government has passed a wave of liberal policies, such as abortion
    on request, a limited form of euthanasia, no-fault divorce, and same-sex marriage.
    On January 29, 2016, it ceased to be called the Federal District (Spanish: Distrito
    Federal or D.F.) and is now in transition to become the country''s 32nd federal
    entity, giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state. Because of
    a clause in the Mexican Constitution, however, as the seat of the powers of the
    Union, it can never become a state, lest the capital of the country be relocated
    elsewhere.'
  question: What was Mexico City's old affiliation with the nation of Mexico?
- answer: chloroplasts
  context: Plants and various other groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes collectively
    known as "algae" have unique organelles known as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are
    thought to be descended from cyanobacteria that formed endosymbiotic relationships
    with ancient plant and algal ancestors. Chloroplasts and cyanobacteria contain
    the blue-green pigment chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll a (as well as its plant and
    green algal-specific cousin chlorophyll b)[a] absorbs light in the blue-violet
    and orange/red parts of the spectrum while reflecting and transmitting the green
    light that we see as the characteristic colour of these organisms. The energy
    in the red and blue light that these pigments absorb is used by chloroplasts to
    make energy-rich carbon compounds from carbon dioxide and water by oxygenic photosynthesis,
    a process that generates molecular oxygen (O2) as a by-product.
  question: what parts of algae are unique to them?
- answer: '2013'
  context: Sessions for West's sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013
    in his own personal loft's living room at a Paris hotel. Determined to "undermine
    the commercial", he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted
    to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music. Primarily
    inspired by architecture, West's perfectionist tendencies led him to contact producer
    Rick Rubin fifteen days shy of its due date to strip down the record's sound in
    favor of a more minimalist approach. Initial promotion of his sixth album included
    worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances.
    Yeezus, West's sixth album, was released June 18, 2013 to rave reviews from critics.
    It became the rapper's sixth consecutive number one debut, but also marked his
    lowest solo opening week sales. Def Jam issued "Black Skinhead" to radio in July
    2013 as the album's lead single. On September 6, 2013, Kanye West announced he
    would be headlining his first solo tour in five years, to support Yeezus, with
    fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar accompanying him along the way.
  question: In what year did Kanye West begin working on his sixth album?
- answer: Rabobank, a large bank, has its headquarters in Utrecht.
  context: "Production industry constitutes a small part of the economy of Utrecht.\
    \ The economy of Utrecht depends for a large part on the several large institutions\
    \ located in the city. It is the centre of the Dutch railroad network and the\
    \ location of the head office of Nederlandse Spoorwegen. ProRail is headquartered\
    \ in The De Inktpot (nl) (The Inkpot) \u2013 the largest brick building in the\
    \ Netherlands (the \"UFO\" featured on its fa\xE7ade stems from an art program\
    \ in 2000). Rabobank, a large bank, has its headquarters in Utrecht."
  question: What bank is head quartered in Utrecht
- answer: For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids
    and LABAs
  context: For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids
    and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option. It involves the delivery of
    controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.
    While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears
    to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown. Evidence
    suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and
    asthma improve outcomes.
  question: What type of person would use bronchial thermoplasty as an option?
- answer: the Royal Navy
  context: Another deck structure that can be seen is a ski-jump ramp at the forward
    end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft
    take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff
    on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted
    by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some
    of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is
    sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows
    heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient
    air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully
    loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller
    flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.
  question: Who originally developed the ski-jump ramp?
- answer: Toyotomi Hideyoshi
  context: Society in the Japanese "Tokugawa period" (Edo society), unlike the shogunates
    before it, was based on the strict class hierarchy originally established by Toyotomi
    Hideyoshi. The daimyo, or lords, were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste
    of samurai, with the farmers, artisans, and traders ranking below. In some parts
    of the country, particularly smaller regions, daimyo and samurai were more or
    less identical, since daimyo might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act
    as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this social stratification
    system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the peasantry were set
    at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary
    value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were
    worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between
    noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants, ranging from simple local
    disturbances to much bigger rebellions. None, however, proved compelling enough
    to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.
  question: Strict class hierarchy was established by who?
- answer: third most abundant
  context: Under ordinary conditions on Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic
    gas, H2. However, hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (1 ppm by
    volume) because of its light weight, which enables it to escape from Earth's gravity
    more easily than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element
    on the Earth's surface, mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons
    and water. Hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural
    component of flatus, as is methane, itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance.
  question: How abundant is hydrogen on the earths surface?
- answer: Ganj-i-Sawai,
  context: "In September 1695, Captain Henry Every, an English pirate on board the\
    \ Fancy, reached the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, where he teamed up with five other\
    \ pirate captains to make an attack on the Indian fleet making the annual voyage\
    \ to Mocha. The Mughal convoy included the treasure-laden Ganj-i-Sawai, reported\
    \ to be the greatest in the Mughal fleet and the largest ship operational in the\
    \ Indian Ocean, and its escort, the Fateh Muhammed. They were spotted passing\
    \ the straits en route to Surat. The pirates gave chase and caught up with Fateh\
    \ Muhammed some days later, and meeting little resistance, took some \xA350,000\
    \ to \xA360,000 worth of treasure."
  question: waht was the name of largest ship operating in the Indian ocean?
- answer: John DeStefano, Jr.
  context: When John DeStefano, Jr., became mayor of New Haven in 1995, he outlined
    a plan to transform the city into a major cultural and arts center in the Northeast,
    which involved investments in programs and projects other than sports franchises.
    As nearby Bridgeport built new sports facilities, the brutalist New Haven Coliseum
    rapidly deteriorated. Believing the upkeep on the venue to be a drain of tax dollars,
    the DeStefano administration closed the Coliseum in 2002; it was demolished in
    2007. New Haven's last professional sports team, the New Haven County Cutters,
    left in 2009. The DeStefano administration did, however, see the construction
    of the New Haven Athletic Center in 1998, a 94,000-square-foot (8,700 m2) indoor
    athletic facility with a seating capacity of over 3,000. The NHAC, built adjacent
    to Hillhouse High School, is used for New Haven public schools athletics, as well
    as large-scale area and state sporting events; it is the largest high school indoor
    sports complex in the state.
  question: What 1995 mayor of New Haven sought to reinvent the area into a northeastern
    hub of art and culture?
- answer: in 1140
  context: At the completion of the west front in 1140, Abbot Suger moved on to the
    reconstruction of the eastern end, leaving the Carolingian nave in use. He designed
    a choir that would be suffused with light. To achieve his aims, his masons drew
    on the several new features which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque
    architecture, the pointed arch, the ribbed vault, the ambulatory with radiating
    chapels, the clustered columns supporting ribs springing in different directions
    and the flying buttresses which enabled the insertion of large clerestory windows.
  question: When was the west front of Saint Denis completed?
- answer: hover
  context: If the aircraft are VTOL-capable or helicopters, they do not need to decelerate
    and hence there is no such need. The arrested-recovery system has used an angled
    deck since the 1950s because, in case the aircraft does not catch the arresting
    wire, the short deck allows easier take off by reducing the number of objects
    between the aircraft and the end of the runway. It also has the advantage of separating
    the recovery operation area from the launch area. Helicopters and aircraft capable
    of vertical or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) usually recover by coming abreast
    the carrier on the port side and then using their hover capability to move over
    the flight deck and land vertically without the need for arresting gear.
  question: What capability do helicopters use to move over the flight deck and land
    vertically?
- answer: '1991'
  context: During their investigation of Noriega, Kerry's staff found reason to believe
    that the Pakistan-based Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) had facilitated
    Noriega's drug trafficking and money laundering. This led to a separate inquiry
    into BCCI, and as a result, banking regulators shut down BCCI in 1991. In December
    1992, Kerry and Senator Hank Brown, a Republican from Colorado, released The BCCI
    Affair, a report on the BCCI scandal. The report showed that the bank was crooked
    and was working with terrorists, including Abu Nidal. It blasted the Department
    of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, the Customs Service, the Federal Reserve
    Bank, as well as influential lobbyists and the CIA.
  question: When was BCCI shut down?
- answer: oppressive
  context: "The six Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe, while nominally independent,\
    \ were widely recognized in the international community as the Soviet satellite\
    \ states. All had been occupied by the Soviet Red Army in 1945, had Soviet-style\
    \ socialist states imposed upon them, and had very restricted freedom of action\
    \ in either domestic or international affairs. Any moves towards real independence\
    \ were suppressed by military force \u2013 in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\
    \ and the Prague Spring in 1968. Gorbachev abandoned the oppressive and expensive\
    \ Brezhnev Doctrine, which mandated intervention in the Warsaw Pact states, in\
    \ favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of allies \u2013 jokingly\
    \ termed the Sinatra Doctrine in a reference to the Frank Sinatra song \"My Way\"\
    ."
  question: Other than being expensive what was wrong with the Brezhnev Doctrine?
- answer: Mahavira
  context: "Increasing urbanisation of India in 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the\
    \ rise of new ascetic or shramana movements which challenged the orthodoxy of\
    \ rituals. Mahavira (c. 549\u2013477 BC), proponent of Jainism, and Buddha (c.\
    \ 563-483), founder of Buddhism were the most prominent icons of this movement.\
    \ Shramana gave rise to the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept\
    \ of samsara, and the concept of liberation. Buddha found a Middle Way that ameliorated\
    \ the extreme asceticism found in the Sramana religions."
  question: Who was the founder of Jainism?
- answer: Skidmore, Owings & Merrill
  context: 'Richmond is home to several notable instances of various styles of modernism.
    Minoru Yamasaki designed the Federal Reserve Building which dominates the downtown
    skyline. The architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill has designed two
    buildings: the Library of Virginia and the General Assembly Offices at the Eighth
    and Main Building. Philip Johnson designed the WRVA Building. The Richard Neutra-designed
    Rice House, a residence on a private island on the James River, remains Richmond''s
    only true International Style home. The W.G. Harris residence in Richmond was
    designed by famed early modern architect and member of the Harvard Five, Landis
    Gores. Other notable architects to have worked in the city include Rick Mather,
    I.M. Pei, and Gordon Bunshaft.'
  question: Who designed the General Assembly Offices at the Eighth and Main Building?
- answer: Pennsylvania
  context: The earliest known American lodges were in Pennsylvania. The Collector
    for the port of Pennsylvania, John Moore, wrote of attending lodges there in 1715,
    two years before the formation of the first Grand Lodge in London. The Premier
    Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in
    1731, based in Pennsylvania. Other lodges in the colony obtained authorisations
    from the later Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and
    the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which was particularly well represented in the travelling
    lodges of the British Army. Many lodges came into existence with no warrant from
    any Grand Lodge, applying and paying for their authorisation only after they were
    confident of their own survival.
  question: The Provincial Grand Master for North America was base where?
- answer: matching blue tracksuits
  context: The Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee sent out a team of 30 unarmed
    attendants selected from the People's Armed Police to escort the flame throughout
    its journey. According to Asian Times, sworn in as the "Beijing Olympic Games
    Sacred Flame Protection Unit" during a ceremony in August 2007, their main job
    is to keep the Olympic flame alight throughout the journey and to assist in transferring
    the flame between the torches, the lanterns and the cauldrons. They wear matching
    blue tracksuits and are intended to accompany the torch every step of the way.
    One of the torch attendants, dubbed "Second Right Brother," has developed a significant
    online fan-base, particularly among China's female netizens.
  question: What were their official team outfits?
- answer: the climatic conditions and area of the region
  context: The number and variety of plants, animals and other organisms that exist
    is known as biodiversity. It is an essential component of nature and it ensures
    the survival of human species by providing food, fuel, shelter, medicines and
    other resources to mankind. The richness of biodiversity depends on the climatic
    conditions and area of the region. All species of plants taken together are known
    as flora and about 70,000 species of plants are known till date. All species of
    animals taken together are known as fauna which includes birds, mammals, fish,
    reptiles, insects, crustaceans, molluscs, etc.
  question: What influences richness of biodiversity?
- answer: Eiffel Tower
  context: "France: The torch relay leg in Paris, held on April 7, began on the first\
    \ level of the Eiffel Tower and finished at the Stade Charl\xE9ty. The relay was\
    \ initially supposed to cover 28 km, but it was shortened at the demand of Chinese\
    \ officials following widespread protests by pro-Tibet and human rights activists,\
    \ who repeatedly attempted to disrupt, hinder or halt the procession. A scheduled\
    \ ceremony at the town hall was cancelled at the request of the Chinese authorities,\
    \ and, also at the request of Chinese authorities, the torch finished the relay\
    \ by bus instead of being carried by athletes. Paris City officials had announced\
    \ plans to greet the Olympic flame with peaceful protest when the torch was to\
    \ reach the French capital. The city government attached a banner reading \"Paris\
    \ defends human rights throughout the world\" to the City Hall, in an attempt\
    \ to promote values \"of all humanity and of human rights.\" Members from Reporters\
    \ Without Borders turned out in large numbers to protest. An estimated 3,000 French\
    \ police protected the Olympic torch relay as it departed from the Eiffel Tower\
    \ and criss-crossed Paris amid threat of protests. Widespread pro-Tibet protests,\
    \ including an attempt by more than one demonstrator to extinguish the flame with\
    \ water or fire extinguishers, prompted relay authorities to put out the flame\
    \ five times (according to the police authorities in Paris) and load the torch\
    \ onto a bus, at the demand of Chinese officials. This was later denied by the\
    \ Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, despite video footage broadcast by French\
    \ television network France 2 which showed Chinese flame attendants extinguishing\
    \ the torch. Backup flames are with the relay at all times to relight the torch.\
    \ French judoka and torchbearer David Douillet expressed his annoyance at the\
    \ Chinese flame attendants who extinguished the torch which he was about to hand\
    \ over to Teddy Riner: \"I understand they're afraid of everything, but this is\
    \ just annoying. They extinguished the flame despite the fact that there was no\
    \ risk, and they could see it and they knew it. I don't know why they did it.\""
  question: Where location was the torch relay started in the city in Paris?
- answer: Ottoman
  context: "In the beginning, the Quran did not have vocalization markings. The system\
    \ of vocalization, as we know it today, seems to have been introduced towards\
    \ the end of the ninth century. Since it would have been too costly for most Muslims\
    \ to purchase a manuscript, copies of the Quran were held in mosques in order\
    \ to make them accessible to people. These copies frequently took the form of\
    \ a series of 30 parts or juz\u02BC. In terms of productivity, the Ottoman copyists\
    \ provide the best example. This was in response to widespread demand, unpopularity\
    \ of printing methods and for aesthetic reasons."
  question: Which group of Quran copyists produced the most in-demand manuscripts?
- answer: Omran Shaaban
  context: On the afternoon of Gaddafi's death, NTC Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril
    publicly revealed the news. Gaddafi's corpse was placed in the freezer of a local
    market alongside the corpses of Yunis Jabr and Mutassim; the bodies were publicly
    displayed for four days, with Libyans from all over the country coming to view
    them. In response to international calls, on 24 October Jibril announced that
    a commission would investigate Gaddafi's death. On 25 October, the NTC announced
    that Gaddafi had been buried at an unidentified location in the desert; Al Aan
    TV showed amateur video footage of the funeral. Seeking vengeance for the killing,
    Gaddafist sympathisers fatally wounded one of those who had captured Gaddafi,
    Omran Shaaban, near Bani Walid in September 2012.
  question: Who was killed by Gaddafi supporters for his role in Gaddafi's capture?
- answer: sentencing
  context: "In 1976, contemporaneously with Woodson and Roberts, the Court decided\
    \ Gregg v. Georgia and upheld a procedure in which the trial of capital crimes\
    \ was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding,\
    \ the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise\
    \ not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed.\
    \ At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating\
    \ factors exist, whether any mitigating factors exist, and, in many jurisdictions,\
    \ weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty\
    \ \u2013 either death or life in prison, either with or without parole."
  question: Along with the guilt-innocence phase, what is the other phase of a death
    penalty trial under Gregg v. Georgia?
- answer: Dollar
  context: The early currency of the United States did not exhibit faces of presidents,
    as is the custom now; although today, by law, only the portrait of a deceased
    individual may appear on United States currency. In fact, the newly formed government
    was against having portraits of leaders on the currency, a practice compared to
    the policies of European monarchs. The currency as we know it today did not get
    the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century; before that
    "heads" side of coinage used profile faces and striding, seated, and standing
    figures from Greek and Roman mythology and composite Native Americans. The last
    coins to be converted to profiles of historic Americans were the dime (1946) and
    the Dollar (1971).
  question: What was the last coin to be converted to the modern day style of having
    historic Americans on the face?
- answer: Abu Bakr Ibn Tufail
  context: In the 12th century CE the Andalusian Muslim philosopher and novelist Abu
    Bakr Ibn Tufail (known as "Abubacer" or "Ebn Tophail" in the West) included the
    theory of tabula rasa as a thought experiment in his Arabic philosophical novel,
    Hayy ibn Yaqdhan in which he depicted the development of the mind of a feral child
    "from a tabula rasa to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society" on
    a desert island, through experience alone. The Latin translation of his philosophical
    novel, entitled Philosophus Autodidactus, published by Edward Pococke the Younger
    in 1671, had an influence on John Locke's formulation of tabula rasa in An Essay
    Concerning Human Understanding.
  question: What was 'Abubacer' normally called?
- answer: Adam Mickiewicz
  context: "In Paris, Chopin encountered artists and other distinguished figures,\
    \ and found many opportunities to exercise his talents and achieve celebrity.\
    \ During his years in Paris he was to become acquainted with, among many others,\
    \ Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Ferdinand Hiller, Heinrich Heine, Eug\xE8ne Delacroix,\
    \ and Alfred de Vigny. Chopin was also acquainted with the poet Adam Mickiewicz,\
    \ principal of the Polish Literary Society, some of whose verses he set as songs."
  question: What was the name of the poet Chopin became acquainted with in Paris?
- answer: patent disputes
  context: The Bell family home was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until 1880 when Bell's
    father-in-law bought a house in Washington, D.C., and later in 1882 bought a home
    in the same city for Bell's family, so that they could be with him while he attended
    to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes.
  question: What did Bell have to go to court for in D.C.?
- answer: the CPC
  context: At present, the full name of the government of Nanjing is "People's Government
    of Nanjing City" and the city is under the one-party rule of the CPC, with the
    CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary as the de facto governor of the city and the mayor
    as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.
  question: What party rules Nanjing?
- answer: how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and
    preservation of recent geologic sections.
  context: The fossil record suggests that the last few million years featured the
    greatest biodiversity in history. However, not all scientists support this view,
    since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the
    greater availability and preservation of recent geologic sections. Some scientists
    believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity may not be
    much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago., whereas others consider
    the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life. Estimates
    of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100
    million, with a best estimate of somewhere near 9 million, the vast majority arthropods.
    Diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection.
  question: Why are some scientists uncertain about the fossil record?
- answer: income, life expectancy, and education
  context: 'The 2010 Human Development Report was the first to calculate an Inequality-adjusted
    Human Development Index (IHDI), which factors in inequalities in the three basic
    dimensions of human development (income, life expectancy, and education). Below
    is a list of countries in the top quartile by IHDI:'
  question: In the IHDI, inequality is factored into what three human development
    dimensions?
- answer: far below both the national average
  context: "According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports,\
    \ in 2010 the Raleigh Police Department and other agencies in the city reported\
    \ 1,740 incidents of violent crime and 12,995 incidents of property crime \u2013\
    \ far below both the national average and the North Carolina average. Of the violent\
    \ crimes reported, 14 were murders, 99 were forcible rapes and 643 were robberies.\
    \ Aggravated assault accounted for 984 of the total violent crimes. Property crimes\
    \ included burglaries which accounted for 3,021, larcenies for 9,104 and arson\
    \ for 63 of the total number of incidents. Motor vehicle theft accounted for 870\
    \ incidents out of the total."
  question: How does Raleigh compare in crime to the rest of the country?
- answer: only their chosen foreign language
  context: A few special additions enhance the language-learning experience. For example,
    BYU's International Cinema, featuring films in several languages, is the largest
    and longest-running university-run foreign film program in the country. As already
    noted, BYU also offers an intensive foreign language living experience, the Foreign
    Language Student Residence. This is an on-campus apartment complex where students
    commit to speak only their chosen foreign language while in their apartments.
    Each apartment has at least one native speaker to ensure correct language usage.
  question: As part of the Foreign Language Student Residence program, what do students
    commit to speak while in their apartments?
- answer: the public
  context: Each season premieres with the audition round, taking place in different
    cities. The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists,
    interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants. Each successful contestant
    receives a golden ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood. Based on
    their performances during the Hollywood round (Las Vegas round for seasons 10
    onwards), 24 to 36 contestants are selected by the judges to participate in the
    semifinals. From the semifinal onwards the contestants perform their songs live,
    with the judges making their critiques after each performance. The contestants
    are voted for by the viewing public, and the outcome of the public votes is then
    revealed in the results show typically on the following night. The results shows
    feature group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers. The
    Top-three results show also features the homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists.
    The season reaches its climax in a two-hour results finale show, where the winner
    of the season is revealed.
  question: Who votes for the winning contestants starting with the semi-final round?
- answer: large-scale operations
  context: The USAF's KC-135 and KC-10 aerial refueling aircraft are based on civilian
    jets. The USAF aircraft are equipped primarily for providing the fuel via a tail-mounted
    refueling boom, and can be equipped with "probe and drogue" refueling systems.
    Air-to-air refueling is extensively used in large-scale operations and also used
    in normal operations; fighters, bombers, and cargo aircraft rely heavily on the
    lesser-known "tanker" aircraft. This makes these aircraft an essential part of
    the Air Force's global mobility and the U.S. force projection. The KC-46A Pegasus
    is undergoing testing and is projected to be delivered to USAF units starting
    in 2017.
  question: When is air-to-air refueling primarily used by the US Air Force?
- answer: power per unit surface area
  context: Gain is a parameter which measures the degree of directivity of the antenna's
    radiation pattern. A high-gain antenna will radiate most of its power in a particular
    direction, while a low-gain antenna will radiate over a wider angle. The antenna
    gain, or power gain of an antenna is defined as the ratio of the intensity (power
    per unit surface area)  radiated by the antenna in the direction of its maximum
    output, at an arbitrary distance, divided by the intensity  radiated at the same
    distance by a hypothetical isotropic antenna which radiates equal power in all
    directions. This dimensionless ratio is usually expressed logarithmically in decibels,
    these units are called "decibels-isotropic" (dBi)
  question: What is the meaning of intensity?
- answer: thirteen
  context: "On 7 January 2015, two French Muslim extremists attacked the Paris headquarters\
    \ of Charlie Hebdo and killed thirteen people, and on 9 January, a third terrorist\
    \ killed four hostages during an attack at a Jewish grocery store at Porte de\
    \ Vincennes. On 11 January an estimated 1.5 million people marched in Paris\u2013\
    along with international political leaders\u2013to show solidarity against terrorism\
    \ and in defence of freedom of speech. Ten months later, 13 November 2015, came\
    \ a series of coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris and Saint-Denis claimed by\
    \ the 'Islamic state' organisation ISIL ('Daesh', ISIS); 130 people were killed\
    \ by gunfire and bombs, and more than 350 were injured. Seven of the attackers\
    \ killed themselves and others by setting off their explosive vests. On the morning\
    \ of 18 November three suspected terrorists, including alleged planner of the\
    \ attacks Abdelhamid Abaaoud, were killed in a shootout with police in the Paris\
    \ suburb of Saint-Denis. President Hollande declared France to be in a three-month\
    \ state of emergency."
  question: How many people were killed at the Charlie Hebdo attack?
- answer: introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each
    character when encountered alone
  context: Unfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces
    unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when
    encountered alone. To simplify matters plain text data streams, including files,
    on Multics used line feed (LF) alone as a line terminator. Unix and Unix-like
    systems, and Amiga systems, adopted this convention from Multics. The original
    Macintosh OS, Apple DOS, and ProDOS, on the other hand, used carriage return (CR)
    alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple replaced these operating systems
    with the Unix-based OS X operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well.
  question: Why is adding two characters at the ned of a line problemsome?
- answer: A8
  context: 'In mid-2015, a new model of the iPod Touch was announced by Apple, and
    was officially released on the Apple store on July 15, 2015. The sixth generation
    iPod Touch includes a wide variety of spec improvements such as the upgraded A8
    processor and higher-quality screen. The core is over 5 times faster than previous
    models and is built to be roughly on par with the iPhone 5S. It is available in
    5 different colors: Space grey, pink, gold, silver and Product (red).'
  question: What processor model is used in the iPod Touch?
- answer: Sindh in Pakistan
  context: In 712, Arab Muslim general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered most of the Indus
    region in modern-day Pakistan for the Umayyad Empire, incorporating it as the
    "As-Sindh" province with its capital at Al-Mansurah, 72 km (45 mi) north of modern
    Hyderabad in Sindh, Pakistan. After several incursions, the Hindu kings east of
    Indus defeated the Arabs at the Battle of Rajasthan, halting their expansion and
    containing them at Sindh in Pakistan. The south Indian Chalukya empire under Vikramaditya
    II, Nagabhata I of the Pratihara dynasty and Bappa Rawal of the Guhilot dynasty
    repulsed the Arab invaders in the early 8th century.
  question: In what area did the Indian Kings contain the Arabs?
- answer: London to Chester
  context: The Vikings established Danelaw over much of the eastern and northern part
    of England with its boundary roughly stretching from London to Chester. It was
    an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions
    which was formally agreed to by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and west-Saxon king,
    Alfred the Great in 886 AD. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that London was
    "refounded" by Alfred the Great in 886. Archaeological research shows that this
    involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old
    Roman walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased
    dramatically.
  question: Danelaw, established by the Vikings, covered what  geographical area?
- answer: UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English
    clubs playing in European competitions in 1990
  context: However, by the turn of the 1990s the downward trend was starting to reverse;
    England had been successful in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, reaching the semi-finals.
    UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English
    clubs playing in European competitions in 1990 (resulting in Manchester United
    lifting the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991) and the Taylor Report on stadium safety
    standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in
    the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, was published in January of that year.
  question: Did the UEFA remove the 5 year ban on English clubs playing in European
    competitions in 1990?
- answer: Michigan Central Railway Tunnel
  context: "Detroit has four border crossings: the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit\u2013\
    Windsor Tunnel provide motor vehicle thoroughfares, with the Michigan Central\
    \ Railway Tunnel providing railroad access to and from Canada. The fourth border\
    \ crossing is the Detroit\u2013Windsor Truck Ferry, located near the Windsor Salt\
    \ Mine and Zug Island. Near Zug Island, the southwest part of the city was developed\
    \ over a 1,500-acre (610 ha) salt mine that is 1,100 feet (340 m) below the surface.\
    \ The Detroit Salt Company mine has over 100 miles (160 km) of roads within."
  question: What is the railway tunnel to Canada called?
- answer: 8,000
  context: 'Early on, American courts, even after the Revolution, often did cite contemporary
    English cases. This was because appellate decisions from many American courts
    were not regularly reported until the mid-19th century; lawyers and judges, as
    creatures of habit, used English legal materials to fill the gap. But citations
    to English decisions gradually disappeared during the 19th century as American
    courts developed their own principles to resolve the legal problems of the American
    people. The number of published volumes of American reports soared from eighteen
    in 1810 to over 8,000 by 1910. By 1879 one of the delegates to the California
    constitutional convention was already complaining: "Now, when we require them
    to state the reasons for a decision, we do not mean they shall write a hundred
    pages of detail. We [do] not mean that they shall include the small cases, and
    impose on the country all this fine judicial literature, for the Lord knows we
    have got enough of that already."'
  question: By 1910, how many volumes of American reports were there?
- answer: Chen Hongming
  context: On Thursday, September 15, 2011, more than 500 people from Hongxiao Village
    protested over the large-scale death of fish in a nearby river. Angry protesters
    stormed the Zhejiang Jinko Solar Company factory compound, overturned eight company
    vehicles, and destroyed the offices before police came to disperse the crowd.
    Protests continued on the two following nights with reports of scuffles, officials
    said. Chen Hongming, a deputy head of Haining's environmental protection bureau,
    said the factory's waste disposal had failed pollution tests since April. The
    environmental watchdog had warned the factory, but it had not effectively controlled
    the pollution, Chen added.
  question: Who was the deputy head of Haining's environmental protection bureau at
    the time?
- answer: those that are from Armenia
  context: "Armenians have had a presence in the Armenian Highland for over four thousand\
    \ years, since the time when Hayk, the legendary patriarch and founder of the\
    \ first Armenian nation, led them to victory over Bel of Babylon. Today, with\
    \ a population of 3.5 million, they not only constitute an overwhelming majority\
    \ in Armenia, but also in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians in\
    \ the diaspora informally refer to them as Hayastantsis (\u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\
    \u057D\u057F\u0561\u0576\u0581\u056B), meaning those that are from Armenia (that\
    \ is, those born and raised in Armenia). They, as well as the Armenians of Iran\
    \ and Russia speak the Eastern dialect of the Armenian language. The country itself\
    \ is secular as a result of Soviet domination, but most of its citizens identify\
    \ themselves as Apostolic Armenian Christian."
  question: What does Hayastantsis mean?
- answer: temperate grassland and forest
  context: According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area
    of 656.3 square miles (1,700 km2); this comprises 634.0 square miles (1,642 km2)
    of land and 22.3 square miles (58 km2) of water. The Piney Woods is north of Houston.
    Most of Houston is located on the gulf coastal plain, and its vegetation is classified
    as temperate grassland and forest. Much of the city was built on forested land,
    marshes, swamp, or prairie which resembles the Deep South, and are all still visible
    in surrounding areas. Flatness of the local terrain, when combined with urban
    sprawl, has made flooding a recurring problem for the city. Downtown stands about
    50 feet (15 m) above sea level, and the highest point in far northwest Houston
    is about 125 feet (38 m) in elevation. The city once relied on groundwater for
    its needs, but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground-level water sources
    such as Lake Houston, Lake Conroe and Lake Livingston. The city owns surface water
    rights for 1.20 billion gallons of water a day in addition to 150 million gallons
    a day worth of groundwater.
  question: How is the vegetation of the area classified?
- answer: Europe
  context: Gaddafi financially supported other militant groups across the world, including
    the Black Panther Party, Nation of Islam, Tupamaros, 19th of April Movement and
    Sandinista National Liberation Front in the Americas, the ANC among other liberation
    movements in the fight against Apartheid in South Africa, the Provisional Irish
    Republican Army, ETA, Sardinian nationalists, Action directe, the Red Brigades,
    and the Red Army Faction in Europe, and the Armenian Secret Army, Japanese Red
    Army, Free Aceh Movement, and Moro National Liberation Front in Asia. Gaddafi
    was indiscriminate in the causes he funded, sometimes switching from supporting
    one side in a conflict to the other, as in the Eritrean War of Independence. Throughout
    the 1970s these groups received financial support from Libya, which came to be
    seen as a leader in the Third World's struggle against colonialism and neocolonialism.
    Though many of these groups were labelled "terrorists" by critics of their activities,
    Gaddafi rejected such a characterisation, instead considering them revolutionaries
    engaged in liberation struggles.
  question: On what continent did the Red Army Faction operate?
- answer: Edward VI
  context: In England, the 16th-century European Reformation resulted in a number
    of executions on charges of heresy. During the thirty-eight years of Henry VIII's
    reign, about sixty heretics, mainly Protestants, were executed and a rather greater
    number of Catholics lost their lives on grounds of political offences such as
    treason, notably Sir Thomas More and Cardinal John Fisher, for refusing to accept
    the king's supremacy over the Church in England. Under Edward VI, the heresy laws
    were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by Mary I; even so two radicals
    were executed in Edward's reign (one for denying the reality of the incarnation,
    the other for denying Christ's divinity). Under Mary, around two hundred and ninety
    people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of
    papal jurisdiction. When Elizabeth I came to the throne, the concept of heresy
    was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 Act of Supremacy and
    the one hundred and eighty or so Catholics who were executed in the forty-five
    years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of "...a
    subversive fifth column." The last execution of a "heretic" in England occurred
    under James VI and I in 1612. Although the charge was technically one of "blasphemy"
    there was one later execution in Scotland (still at that date an entirely independent
    kingdom) when in 1697 Thomas Aikenhead was accused, among other things, of denying
    the doctrine of the Trinity.
  question: Under which king were the heresy laws repealed in 1547?
- answer: al-Azhar
  context: "However, the classification of madaris as \"universities\" is disputed\
    \ on the question of understanding of each institution on its own terms. In madaris,\
    \ the ij\u0101zahs were only issued in one field, the Islamic religious law of\
    \ shar\u012B\u02BBah, and in no other field of learning. Other academic subjects,\
    \ including the natural sciences, philosophy and literary studies, were only treated\
    \ \"ancillary\" to the study of the Sharia. For example, a natural science like\
    \ astronomy was only studied (if at all) to supply religious needs, like the time\
    \ for prayer. This is why Ptolemaic astronomy was considered adequate, and is\
    \ still taught in some modern day madaris. The Islamic law undergraduate degree\
    \ from al-Azhar, the most prestigious madrasa, was traditionally granted without\
    \ final examinations, but on the basis of the students' attentive attendance to\
    \ courses. In contrast to the medieval doctorate which was granted by the collective\
    \ authority of the faculty, the Islamic degree was not granted by the teacher\
    \ to the pupil based on any formal criteria, but remained a \"personal matter,\
    \ the sole prerogative of the person bestowing it; no one could force him to give\
    \ one\"."
  question: What is considered the most famous madrasa?
- answer: minor damage
  context: Even with the five largest cities in Sichuan suffering only minor damage
    from the quake, some estimates of the economic loss run higher than US$75 billion,
    making the earthquake one of the costliest natural disasters in Chinese history.
  question: What damage did the major Sichuan cities have?
- answer: automation
  context: Surface-mount technology emerged in the 1960s, gained momentum in the early
    1980s and became widely used by the mid-1990s. Components were mechanically redesigned
    to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be soldered directly onto the
    PCB surface, instead of wire leads to pass through holes. Components became much
    smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common
    than with through-hole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much
    higher circuit densities. Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree
    of automation, reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates. Components
    can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about
    one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and
    passive components much cheaper; prices of semiconductor surface mount devices
    (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price
    advantage over larger packages. Some wire-ended components, such as 1N4148 small-signal
    switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.
  question: What improvement is possible with surface-mounting that enables higher
    production and lower labor costs?
- answer: "Bart\xE9lemy Lebrun"
  context: "A pre-war plan laid out by the late Marshal Niel called for a strong French\
    \ offensive from Thionville towards Trier and into the Prussian Rhineland. This\
    \ plan was discarded in favour of a defensive plan by Generals Charles Frossard\
    \ and Bart\xE9lemy Lebrun, which called for the Army of the Rhine to remain in\
    \ a defensive posture near the German border and repel any Prussian offensive.\
    \ As Austria along with Bavaria, W\xFCrttemberg and Baden were expected to join\
    \ in a revenge war against Prussia, I Corps would invade the Bavarian Palatinate\
    \ and proceed to \"free\" the South German states in concert with Austro-Hungarian\
    \ forces. VI Corps would reinforce either army as needed."
  question: Niel's plan was cast aside in favour of a plan by General Frossard and
    what other general??
- answer: "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"
  context: "Following the completion of his PhD in 1942, Feynman held an appointment\
    \ at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison as an assistant professor of physics.\
    \ The appointment was spent on leave for his involvement in the Manhattan project.\
    \ In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters\
    \ and Science requesting his return to UW to teach in the coming academic year.\
    \ His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to return. In a talk\

  question: Where did Feynman receive a job after getting his PhD?
- answer: the last thirty
  context: "A \"country pub\" by tradition is a rural public house. However, the distinctive\
    \ culture surrounding country pubs, that of functioning as a social centre for\
    \ a village and rural community, has been changing over the last thirty or so\
    \ years. In the past, many rural pubs provided opportunities for country folk\
    \ to meet and exchange (often local) news, while others\u2014especially those\
    \ away from village centres\u2014existed for the general purpose, before the advent\
    \ of motor transport, of serving travellers as coaching inns."
  question: Over what period of years has the traditional function of country pubs
    been changing?
- answer: mercury
  context: 'While LEDs have the advantage over fluorescent lamps that they do not
    contain mercury, they may contain other hazardous metals such as lead and arsenic.
    Regarding the toxicity of LEDs when treated as waste, a study published in 2011
    stated: "According to federal standards, LEDs are not hazardous except for low-intensity
    red LEDs, which leached Pb [lead] at levels exceeding regulatory limits (186 mg/L;
    regulatory limit: 5). However, according to California regulations, excessive
    levels of copper (up to 3892 mg/kg; limit: 2500), lead (up to 8103 mg/kg; limit:
    1000), nickel (up to 4797 mg/kg; limit: 2000), or silver (up to 721 mg/kg; limit:
    500) render all except low-intensity yellow LEDs hazardous."'
  question: What substance does fluorescent lamps contain?
- answer: pamphlet
  context: On 6 April 1941, German forces, with Hungarian and Italian assistance,
    launched an invasion of Yugoslavia. On 10 April 1941, Slavko Kvaternik proclaimed
    the Independent State of Croatia, and Tito responded by forming a Military Committee
    within the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party. Attacked from all
    sides, the armed forces of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia quickly crumbled. On 17 April
    1941, after King Peter II and other members of the government fled the country,
    the remaining representatives of the government and military met with the German
    officials in Belgrade. They quickly agreed to end military resistance. On 1 May
    1941, Tito issued a pamphlet calling on the people to unite in a battle against
    the occupation. On 27 June 1941, the Central Committee of the Communist Party
    of Yugoslavia appointed Tito Commander in Chief of all project national liberation
    military forces. On 1 July 1941, the Comintern sent precise instructions calling
    for immediate action.
  question: What did Tito use to get the people to unit in a battle against the occupation
    in 1941?
- answer: 256 different numbers
  context: "In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store binary\
    \ numbers in groups of eight bits (called a byte). Each byte is able to represent\
    \ 256 different numbers (28 = 256); either from 0 to 255 or \u2212128 to +127.\
    \ To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two,\
    \ four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored\
    \ in two's complement notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually\
    \ not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer\
    \ can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically.\
    \ Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory."
  question: How many numbers can a byte represent?
- answer: "1549\u20131551"
  context: "Historian H. Paul Varley notes the description of Japan given by Jesuit\
    \ leader St. Francis Xavier (1506\u20131552): \"There is no nation in the world\
    \ which fears death less.\" Xavier further describes the honour and manners of\
    \ the people: \"I fancy that there are no people in the world more punctilious\
    \ about their honour than the Japanese, for they will not put up with a single\
    \ insult or even a word spoken in anger.\" Xavier spent the years 1549\u20131551\
    \ converting Japanese to Christianity. He also observed: \"The Japanese are much\
    \ braver and more warlike than the people of China, Korea, Ternate and all of\
    \ the other nations around the Philippines.\""
  question: When did Xavier try to convert Japan to Christianity?
- answer: rota system
  context: An unconventional power succession system was established (rota system)
    whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather
    than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler,
    fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.[citation needed]
    Familicide was frequently deployed in obtaining power and can be traced particularly
    during the time of the Yaroslavichi rule (sons of Yaroslav) when the established
    system was skipped in the establishment of Vladimir II Monomakh as the Grand Prince
    of Kiev,[clarification needed] in turn creating major squabbles between Olegovichi
    from Chernihiv, Monomakhs from Pereyaslav, Izyaslavichi from Turov/Volhynia, and
    Polotsk Princes.[citation needed]
  question: What was the name of the UN-conventional system that was implemented?
- answer: to indicate Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander ancestry
  context: Indigenous Australians have been referred to as "black people" in Australia
    since the early days of European settlement. While originally related to skin
    colour, the term is used to today to indicate Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander
    ancestry in general and can refer to people of any skin pigmentation.
  question: What does the term relate to know in reference to Australians?
- answer: algebra
  context: Among the results of the Greek and Islamic influence on this period in
    European history was the replacement of Roman numerals with the decimal positional
    number system and the invention of algebra, which allowed more advanced mathematics.
    Astronomy advanced following the translation of Ptolemy's Almagest from Greek
    into Latin in the late 12th century. Medicine was also studied, especially in
    southern Italy, where Islamic medicine influenced the school at Salerno.
  question: What invention led to advances in mathematics?
- answer: October 2006
  context: The CBC's flagship newscast, The National, airs Sunday through Fridays
    at 10:00 p.m. EST and Saturdays at 6:00 p.m. EST. Until October 2006, CBC owned-and-operated
    stations aired a second broadcast of the program at 11:00 p.m.; this later broadcast
    included only the main news portion of the program, and excluded the analysis
    and documentary segment. This second airing was later replaced with other programming,
    and as of the 2012-13 television season, was replaced on CBC's major market stations
    by a half-hour late newscast. There is also a short news update, at most, on late
    Saturday evenings. During hockey season, this update is usually found during the
    first intermission of the second game of the doubleheader on Hockey Night in Canada.
  question: When did CBC discontinue its late-night broadcast of The National?
- answer: Ranulph Glanville
  context: Shortly after his birth, John was passed from Eleanor into the care of
    a wet nurse, a traditional practice for medieval noble families. Eleanor then
    left for Poitiers, the capital of Aquitaine, and sent John and his sister Joan
    north to Fontevrault Abbey. This may have been done with the aim of steering her
    youngest son, with no obvious inheritance, towards a future ecclesiastical career.
    Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither
    parent played a part in John's very early life. John was probably, like his brothers,
    assigned a magister whilst he was at Fontevrault, a teacher charged with his early
    education and with managing the servants of his immediate household; John was
    later taught by Ranulph Glanville, a leading English administrator. John spent
    some time as a member of the household of his eldest living brother Henry the
    Young King, where he probably received instruction in hunting and military skills.
  question: John was taught by who?
- answer: vinyl records
  context: There is a theory that vinyl records can audibly represent higher frequencies
    than compact discs. According to Red Book specifications, the compact disc has
    a frequency response of 20 Hz up to 22,050 Hz, and most CD players measure flat
    within a fraction of a decibel from at least 20 Hz to 20 kHz at full output. Turntable
    rumble obscures the low-end limit of vinyl but the upper end can be, with some
    cartridges, reasonably flat within a few decibels to 30 kHz, with gentle roll-off.
    Carrier signals of Quad LPs popular in the 1970s were at 30 kHz to be out of the
    range of human hearing. The average human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies
    from 20 Hz to a maximum of around 20,000 Hz. The upper and lower frequency limits
    of human hearing vary per person.
  question: What is believed to better offer sounds of higher frequencies, compact
    discs or records?
- answer: Rolling Stone
  context: "Her debut single, \"Crazy in Love\" was named VH1's \"Greatest Song of\
    \ the 2000s\", NME's \"Best Track of the 00s\" and \"Pop Song of the Century\"\
    , considered by Rolling Stone to be one of the 500 greatest songs of all time,\
    \ earned two Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling singles of all time\
    \ at around 8 million copies. The music video for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring\
    \ on It)\", which achieved fame for its intricate choreography and its deployment\
    \ of jazz hands, was credited by the Toronto Star as having started the \"first\
    \ major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet\", triggering\
    \ a number of parodies of the dance choreography and a legion of amateur imitators\
    \ on YouTube. In 2013, Drake released a single titled \"Girls Love Beyonc\xE9\"\
    , which featured an interpolation from Destiny Child's \"Say My Name\" and discussed\
    \ his relationship with women. In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard\
    \ named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse fly found in Northern Queensland,\
    \ Australia after Beyonc\xE9 due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen.\
    \ In July 2014, a Beyonc\xE9 exhibit was introduced into the \"Legends of Rock\"\
    \ section of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The black leotard from the \"Single\
    \ Ladies\" video and her outfit from the Super Bowl half time performance are\
    \ among several pieces housed at the museum."
  question: Which publication considers Crazy in Love to be one of the top 500 songs
    of all time?
- answer: gain
  context: The essential usefulness of a transistor comes from its ability to use
    a small signal applied between one pair of its terminals to control a much larger
    signal at another pair of terminals. This property is called gain. It can produce
    a stronger output signal, a voltage or current, which is proportional to a weaker
    input signal; that is, it can act as an amplifier. Alternatively, the transistor
    can be used to turn current on or off in a circuit as an electrically controlled
    switch, where the amount of current is determined by other circuit elements.
  question: Why is a transistor so useful?
- answer: infectious diseases specialist
  context: The medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field
    of Infectious Disease and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the
    field of Epidemiology. Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary
    care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an "uncomplicated"
    pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung
    physician). The work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working
    with both patients and general practitioners, as well as laboratory scientists,
    immunologists, bacteriologists and other specialists.
  question: Who works with both patients and general practitioners to identify a disease?
- answer: sun outages
  context: A satellite ground station with a 7.6-metre (25 ft) satellite dish installed
    in 1989 at The Briars is the only international connection providing satellite
    links through Intelsat 707 to Ascension island and the United Kingdom. Since all
    international telephone and internet communications are relying on this single
    satellite link both internet and telephone service are subject to sun outages.
  question: Both telephone and internet services are subject to what?
- answer: August 1, 2012
  context: On August 1, 2012, Windows 8 (build 9200) was released to manufacturing
    with the build number 6.2.9200.16384 . Microsoft planned to hold a launch event
    on October 25, 2012 and release Windows 8 for general availability on the next
    day. However, only a day after its release to manufacturing, a copy of the final
    version of Windows 8 Enterprise N (a version for European markets lacking bundled
    media players to comply with a court ruling) leaked online, followed by leaks
    of the final versions of Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise a few days later. On August
    15, 2012, Windows 8 was made available to download for MSDN and TechNet subscribers.
    Windows 8 was made available to Software Assurance customers on August 16, 2012.
    Windows 8 was made available for students with a DreamSpark Premium subscription
    on August 22, 2012, earlier than advertised.
  question: When did Windows 8 manufacturing begin?
- answer: Oro y Plata
  context: "Montana's motto, Oro y Plata, Spanish for \"Gold and Silver\", recognizing\
    \ the significant role of mining, was first adopted in 1865, when Montana was\
    \ still a territory. A state seal with a miner's pick and shovel above the motto,\
    \ surrounded by the mountains and the Great Falls of the Missouri River, was adopted\
    \ during the first meeting of the territorial legislature in 1864\u201365. The\
    \ design was only slightly modified after Montana became a state and adopted it\
    \ as the Great Seal of the State of Montana, enacted by the legislature in 1893.\
    \ The state flower, the bitterroot, was adopted in 1895 with the support of a\
    \ group called the Floral Emblem Association, which formed after Montana's Women's\
    \ Christian Temperance Union adopted the bitterroot as the organization's state\
    \ flower. All other symbols were adopted throughout the 20th century, save for\
    \ Montana's newest symbol, the state butterfly, the mourning cloak, adopted in\
    \ 2001, and the state lullaby, \"Montana Lullaby\", adopted in 2007."
  question: What is Montana's motto?
- answer: '31'
  context: "The above are further subdivided into 31 planes of existence.[web 4] Rebirths\
    \ in some of the higher heavens, known as the \u015Auddh\u0101v\u0101sa Worlds\
    \ or Pure Abodes, can be attained only by skilled Buddhist practitioners known\
    \ as an\u0101g\u0101mis (non-returners). Rebirths in the \u0100r\u016Bpyadh\u0101\
    tu (formless realms) can be attained by only those who can meditate on the ar\u016B\
    pajh\u0101nas, the highest object of meditation."
  question: How many planes of existence are there?
- answer: '1738'
  context: The advent of the Industrial Revolution in Britain provided a great boost
    to cotton manufacture, as textiles emerged as Britain's leading export. In 1738,
    Lewis Paul and John Wyatt, of Birmingham, England, patented the roller spinning
    machine, as well as the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even
    thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds. Later,
    the invention of the James Hargreaves' spinning jenny in 1764, Richard Arkwright's
    spinning frame in 1769 and Samuel Crompton's spinning mule in 1775 enabled British
    spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century
    on, the British city of Manchester acquired the nickname "Cottonopolis" due to
    the cotton industry's omnipresence within the city, and Manchester's role as the
    heart of the global cotton trade.
  question: When was a new spinning machine patented that boosted cotton production?
- answer: farthest known planet
  context: From its discovery in 1846 until the subsequent discovery of Pluto in 1930,
    Neptune was the farthest known planet. When Pluto was discovered it was considered
    a planet, and Neptune thus became the penultimate known planet, except for a 20-year
    period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit brought it closer to
    the Sun than Neptune. The discovery of the Kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers
    to debate whether Pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the Kuiper
    belt. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined the word "planet"
    for the first time, reclassifying Pluto as a "dwarf planet" and making Neptune
    once again the outermost known planet in the Solar System.
  question: What was Neptune before Pluto was discovered?
- answer: Victory Square
  context: 'Russia: On April 5 the Olympic torch arrived at Saint Petersburg, Russia.
    The length of the torch relay route in the city was 20 km, with the start at the
    Victory Square and finish at the Palace Square. Mixed martial arts icon and former
    PRIDE Heavyweight Champion Fedor Emelianenko was one the torch bearers. This gives
    him the distinction of the being the first active MMA fighter to carry the Olympic
    flame.'
  question: What city location did the torch relay begin in Russia?
- answer: Sydney Town Hall
  context: The formation of the party was formally announced at Sydney Town Hall on
    31 August 1945. It took the name "Liberal" in honour of the old Commonwealth Liberal
    Party. The new party was dominated by the remains of the old UAP; with few exceptions,
    the UAP party room became the Liberal party room. The Australian Women's National
    League, a powerful conservative women's organisation, also merged with the new
    party. A conservative youth group Menzies had set up, the Young Nationalists,
    was also merged into the new party. It became the nucleus of the Liberal Party's
    youth division, the Young Liberals. By September 1945 there were more than 90,000
    members, many of whom had not previously been members of any political party.
  question: Where was the formation of the Liberal party officially announced?
- answer: before Christopher Columbus' voyages of 1492
  context: "While technically referring to the era before Christopher Columbus' voyages\
    \ of 1492 to 1504, in practice the term usually includes the history of American\
    \ indigenous cultures until Europeans either conquered or significantly influenced\
    \ them, even if this happened decades or even centuries after Columbus' initial\
    \ landing. \"Pre-Columbian\" is used especially often in the context of discussing\
    \ the great indigenous civilizations of the Americas, such as those of Mesoamerica\
    \ (the Olmec, the Toltec, the Teotihuacano, the Zapotec, the Mixtec, the Aztec,\
    \ and the Maya civilizations) and those of the Andes (Inca Empire, Moche culture,\
    \ Muisca Confederation, Ca\xF1aris)."
  question: The term Pre-Columbian technically refers to which era?
- answer: 21 percent
  context: However, according to research firm NPD, sales of devices running Windows
    in the United States have declined 21 percent compared to the same time period
    in 2011. As the holiday shopping season wrapped up, Windows 8 sales continued
    to lag, even as Apple reported brisk sales. The market research firm IDC reported
    an overall drop in PC sales for the quarter, and said the drop may have been partly
    due to consumer reluctance to embrace the new features of the OS and poor support
    from OEM for these features. This capped the first year of declining PC sales
    to the Asia Pacific region, as consumers bought more mobile devices than Windows
    PCs.
  question: How much of a decrease in sales have Windows devices experienced?
- answer: United States Agency for International Development
  context: In 1993, the newly formed government of Namibia received funding from the
    United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through its Living
    in a Finite Environment (LIFE) Project. The Ministry of Environment and Tourism
    with the financial support from organisations such as USAID, Endangered Wildlife
    Trust, WWF, and Canadian Ambassador's Fund, together form a Community Based Natural
    Resource Management (CBNRM) support structure. The main goal of this project is
    promote sustainable natural resource management by giving local communities rights
    to wildlife management and tourism.
  question: What does USAID stands for?
- answer: better chemical durability
  context: "Fused quartz is a glass made from chemically-pure SiO2 (silica). It has\
    \ excellent thermal shock characteristics, being able to survive immersion in\
    \ water while red hot. However, its high melting-temperature (1723 \xB0C) and\
    \ viscosity make it difficult to work with. Normally, other substances are added\
    \ to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, \"soda\"), which lowers\
    \ the glass transition temperature. The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which\
    \ is usually undesirable, so lime (calcium oxide [CaO], generally obtained from\
    \ limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added\
    \ to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about\
    \ 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass. Soda-lime glasses\
    \ account for about 90% of manufactured glass."
  question: Why is lime often added to glass?
- answer: the medulla and pons
  context: The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal
    cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control
    stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level
    are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for coordinating
    movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex,
    a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary
    motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends
    a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract.
    This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the
    fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects
    by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas
    are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.
  question: At the lowest level of the brain and spinal cord, are what areas?
- answer: minor crimes
  context: 'Some states distinguish between two levels: felonies and misdemeanors
    (minor crimes). Generally, most felony convictions result in lengthy prison sentences
    as well as subsequent probation, large fines, and orders to pay restitution directly
    to victims; while misdemeanors may lead to a year or less in jail and a substantial
    fine. To simplify the prosecution of traffic violations and other relatively minor
    crimes, some states have added a third level, infractions. These may result in
    fines and sometimes the loss of one''s driver''s license, but no jail time.'
  question: What is a misdemeanor?
- answer: "magasin de nouveaut\xE9s"
  context: "The Paris department store had its roots in the magasin de nouveaut\xE9\
    s, or novelty store; the first, the Tapis Rouge, was created in 1784. They flourished\
    \ in the early 19th century, with La Belle Jardiniere (1824), Aux Trois Quartiers\
    \ (1829), and Le Petit Saint Thomas (1830). Balzac described their functioning\
    \ in his novel C\xE9sar Birotteau. In the 1840s, with the arrival of the railroads\
    \ in Paris and the increased number of shoppers they brought, they grew in size,\
    \ and began to have large plate glass display windows, fixed prices and price\
    \ tags, and advertising in newspapers."
  question: What were the origins of the Paris department store?
- answer: 551-600
  context: Cairo University is ranked as 401-500 according to the Academic Ranking
    of World Universities (Shanghai Ranking) and 551-600 according to QS World University
    Rankings. American University in Cairo is ranked as 360 according to QS World
    University Rankings and Al-Azhar University, Alexandria University and Ain Shams
    University fall in the 701+ range. Egypt is currently opening new research institutes
    for the aim of modernising research in the nation, the most recent example of
    which is Zewail City of Science and Technology.
  question: According to QS World University Rankings where does Cairo University
    rank?
- answer: below 600 m
  context: Birds fly at varying altitudes during migration. An expedition to Mt. Everest
    found skeletons of northern pintail Anas acuta and black-tailed godwit Limosa
    limosa at 5,000 m (16,000 ft) on the Khumbu Glacier. Bar-headed geese Anser indicus
    have been recorded by GPS flying at up to 6,540 metres (21,460 ft) while crossing
    the Himalayas, at the same time engaging in the highest rates of climb to altitude
    for any bird. Anecdotal reports of them flying much higher have yet to be corroborated
    with any direct evidence. Seabirds fly low over water but gain altitude when crossing
    land, and the reverse pattern is seen in landbirds. However most bird migration
    is in the range of 150 to 600 m (490 to 1,970 ft). Bird strike aviation records
    from the United States show most collisions occur below 600 m (2,000 ft) and almost
    none above 1,800 m (5,900 ft).
  question: Where do most in air collisions occur?
- answer: Neapolitan
  context: In addition to having evolved, for the most part, separately from one another
    and with distinct individual histories, the Latin-based regional Romance languages
    of Italy are also better classified as separate languages rather than true "dialects"
    due to the often high degree in which they lack mutual intelligibility. Though
    mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which the regional Italian
    languages are mutual unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical
    distance or geographical barriers between the languages, with some regional Italian
    languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to
    each other on the dialect continuum being more or less mutually intelligible.
    For instance, a speaker of purely Eastern Lombard, a language in Northern Italy's
    Lombardy region that includes the Bergamasque dialect, would have severely limited
    mutual intelligibility with a purely standard Italian speaker and would be nearly
    completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure Sicilian language variant. Due
    to Eastern Lombard's status as a Gallo-Italic language, an Eastern Lombard speaker
    may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a Occitan, Catalan, or French
    speaker than a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker. Meanwhile, a Sicilian
    language speaker would have an greater degree of mutual intelligibility with a
    speaker of the more closely related Neapolitan language, but far less mutual intelligibility
    with a person speaking Sicilian Gallo-Italic, a language that developed in isolated
    Lombard emigrant communities on the same island as the Sicilian language.
  question: What type of language is Sicilian?
- answer: Michalis Hatzigiannis and Alkinoos Ioannidis
  context: "Popular music in Cyprus is generally influenced by the Greek La\xEFka\
    \ scene; artists who play in this genre include international platinum star Anna\
    \ Vissi, Evridiki, and Sarbel. Hip Hop, R&B and reggae have been supported by\
    \ the emergence of Cypriot rap and the urban music scene at Ayia Napa. Cypriot\
    \ rock music and \xC9ntekhno rock is often associated with artists such as Michalis\
    \ Hatzigiannis and Alkinoos Ioannidis. Metal also has a small following in Cyprus\
    \ represented by bands such as Armageddon (rev.16:16), Blynd, Winter's Verge and\
    \ Quadraphonic."
  question: Which artists are associated with Cypriot rock music?
- answer: Jonas Salk
  context: During the years 1940-1955, the rate of decline in the U.S. death rate
    accelerated from 2% per year to 8% per year, then returned to the historical rate
    of 2% per year. The dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been
    attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious
    disease that occurred during these years. Vaccine development continued to accelerate,
    with the most notable achievement of the period being Jonas Salk's 1954 development
    of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit National Foundation for
    Infantile Paralysis. The vaccine process was never patented, but was instead given
    to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic. In 1960 Maurice
    Hilleman of Merck Sharp & Dohme identified the SV40 virus, which was later shown
    to cause tumors in many mammalian species. It was later determined that SV40 was
    present as a contaminant in polio vaccine lots that had been administered to 90%
    of the children in the United States. The contamination appears to have originated
    both in the original cell stock and in monkey tissue used for production. In 2004
    the United States Cancer Institute announced that it had concluded that SV40 is
    not associated with cancer in people.
  question: Who created the polio vaccine?
- answer: end of the 16th century
  context: Brass, which is an alloy of copper and zinc, has been used since at least
    the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece. Zinc
    metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was
    unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century. The mines of Rajasthan have
    given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. To
    date, the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early
    as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc.
    Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called "philosopher's wool" or
    "white snow".
  question: When was zinc introduced to Europe?
- answer: destabilising the colony
  context: Unlike other European nations, the Dutch chose not to follow a policy of
    language expansion amongst the indigenous peoples of their colonies. In the last
    quarter of the 19th century, however, a local elite gained proficiency in Dutch
    so as to meet the needs of expanding bureaucracy and business. Nevertheless, the
    Dutch government remained reluctant to teach Dutch on a large scale for fear of
    destabilising the colony. Dutch, the language of power, was supposed to remain
    in the hands of the leading elite.
  question: What was the Dutch government afraid of doing if they taught their colonies
    Dutch?
- answer: By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English.
  context: "At the inception of the Premier League in 1992\u201393, just eleven players\
    \ named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside\
    \ of the United Kingdom or Ireland. By 2000\u201301, the number of foreign players\
    \ participating in the Premier League was 36 per cent of the total. In the 2004\u2013\
    05 season the figure had increased to 45 per cent. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea\
    \ became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up,\
    \ and on 14 February 2005 Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign\
    \ 16-man squad for a match. By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League\
    \ were English."
  question: In 2009, what percent of the players were English in the Premier League?
- answer: skin-lighting
  context: 'Patterns such as those seen in human physical and genetic variation as
    described above, have led to the consequence that the number and geographic location
    of any described races is highly dependent on the importance attributed to, and
    quantity of, the traits considered. Scientists discovered a skin-lighting mutation
    that partially accounts for the appearance of Light skin in humans (people who
    migrated out of Africa northward into what is now Europe) which they estimate
    occurred 20,000 to 50,000 years ago. The East Asians owe their relatively light
    skin to different mutations. On the other hand, the greater the number of traits
    (or alleles) considered, the more subdivisions of humanity are detected, since
    traits and gene frequencies do not always correspond to the same geographical
    location. Or as Ossorio & Duster (2005) put it:'
  question: What mutation did scientists discover?
- answer: '12'
  context: 'Kurita''s "Center Force" consisted of five battleships, 12 cruisers and
    13 destroyers. It included the two largest battleships ever built: Yamato and
    Musashi. As they passed Palawan Island after midnight on 23 October the force
    was spotted, and U.S. submarines sank two cruisers. On 24 October, as Kurita''s
    force entered the Sibuyan Sea, USS Intrepid and USS Cabot launched 260 planes,
    which scored hits on several ships. A second wave of planes scored many direct
    hits on Musashi. A third wave, from USS Enterprise and USS Franklin hit Musashi
    with 11 bombs and eight torpedoes. Kurita retreated but in the evening turned
    around to head for San Bernardino Strait. Musashi sank at about 19:30.'
  question: How many cruisers were in Kurita's "Center Force"?
- answer: 22nd
  context: "The University of Plymouth enrolls 25,895 total students as of 2014/15\
    \ (22nd largest in the UK out of 165). It also employs 3,000 staff with an annual\

    \ in an attempt to improve access to dental care in the South West."
  question: Where does the University of Plymouth rank among British institutions
    of higher education in terms of number of enrolled students?
- answer: to track information about users
  context: For instance, a common use of a database system is to track information
    about users, their name, login information, various addresses and phone numbers.
    In the navigational approach all of this data would be placed in a single record,
    and unused items would simply not be placed in the database. In the relational
    approach, the data would be normalized into a user table, an address table and
    a phone number table (for instance). Records would be created in these optional
    tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided.
  question: How is a database system frequently used?
- answer: Carl Lange
  context: "In the late 19th century, the most influential theorists were William\
    \ James (1842\u20131910) and Carl Lange (1834\u20131900). James was an American\
    \ psychologist and philosopher who wrote about educational psychology, psychology\
    \ of religious experience/mysticism, and the philosophy of pragmatism. Lange was\
    \ a Danish physician and psychologist. Working independently, they developed the\
    \ James\u2013Lange theory, a hypothesis on the origin and nature of emotions.\
    \ The theory states that within human beings, as a response to experiences in\
    \ the world, the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as\
    \ muscular tension, a rise in heart rate, perspiration, and dryness of the mouth.\
    \ Emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological\
    \ changes, rather than being their cause."
  question: Along with William James, who was an influential 19th century theorist?
- answer: the intricacies of European diplomatic customs
  context: In some rare cases, such as with Ethiopia and Qing Dynasty China, the local
    governments were able to use the treaties to at least mitigate the impact of European
    colonization. This involved learning the intricacies of European diplomatic customs
    and then using the treaties to prevent a power from overstepping their agreement
    or by playing different powers against each other.
  question: What did Ethiopians learn in order to use treaties to prevent a European
    power from overstepping their agreement?
- answer: three-quarters, from 25,000 to 40,000 inhabitants
  context: The discovery of gold in Victoria in mid 1851 led to the Victorian gold
    rush, and Melbourne, which served as the major port and provided most services
    for the region, experienced rapid growth. Within months, the city's population
    had increased by nearly three-quarters, from 25,000 to 40,000 inhabitants. Thereafter,
    growth was exponential and by 1865, Melbourne had overtaken Sydney as Australia's
    most populous city. Additionally, Melbourne along with the Victorian regional
    cities of Ballarat and Geelong became the wealthiest cities in the world during
    the Gold Rush era.
  question: How much did Melbourne's population increase within months of the gold
    rush?
- answer: Stalin
  context: On March 3, 1944, on the orders of Stalin, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was
    disbanded and its population forcibly deported upon the accusations of collaboration
    with the invaders and separatism. The territory of the ASSR was divided between
    other administrative unit of Russian SFSR and the Georgian SSR.
  question: Who ordered the deportation of the residents of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR?
- answer: 1,125
  context: "In 1958, the Soviet Union developed \u0422ransformator (Russian: \u0422\
    \u0440\u0430\u043D\u0441\u0444\u043E\u0440\u043C\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0440, meaning\
    \ Transformer), the first high-resolution (definition) television system capable\
    \ of producing an image composed of 1,125 lines of resolution aimed at providing\
    \ teleconferencing for military command. It was a research project and the system\
    \ was never deployed by either the military or consumer broadcasting."
  question: How many lines of resolution could an image using the Transformator system
    have?
- answer: Dorgon
  context: First, the Manchus had entered "China proper" because Dorgon responded
    decisively to Wu Sangui's appeal. Then, after capturing Beijing, instead of sacking
    the city as the rebels had done, Dorgon insisted, over the protests of other Manchu
    princes, on making it the dynastic capital and reappointing most Ming officials.
    Choosing Beijing as the capital had not been a straightforward decision, since
    no major Chinese dynasty had directly taken over its immediate predecessor's capital.
    Keeping the Ming capital and bureaucracy intact helped quickly stabilize the regime
    and sped up the conquest of the rest of the country. However, not all of Dorgon's
    policies were equally popular nor easily implemented.
  question: Who made Beijing his capital?
- answer: Charmian Bond
  context: Despite being an original story, Spectre draws on Ian Fleming's source
    material, most notably in the character of Franz Oberhauser, played by Christoph
    Waltz. Oberhauser shares his name with Hannes Oberhauser, a background character
    in the short story "Octopussy" from the Octopussy and The Living Daylights collection,
    and who is named in the film as having been a temporary legal guardian of a young
    Bond in 1983. Similarly, Charmian Bond is shown to have been his full-time guardian,
    observing the back story established by Fleming. With the acquisition of the rights
    to Spectre and its associated characters, screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert
    Wade revealed that the film would provide a minor retcon to the continuity of
    the previous films, with the Quantum organisation alluded to in Casino Royale
    and introduced in Quantum of Solace reimagined as a division within Spectre rather
    than an independent organisation.
  question: Who was Bond's full time guardian?
- answer: Yuan officeholders
  context: "In 1368, a Han Chinese revolt known as the Red Turban Rebellion toppled\
    \ the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China. Zhu Yuanzhang then established the Ming dynasty,\
    \ ruling as the Hongwu Emperor (r. 1368\u20131398). It is not clear how much the\
    \ early Ming court understood the civil war going on in Tibet between rival religious\
    \ sects, but the first emperor was anxious to avoid the same trouble that Tibet\
    \ had caused for the Tang dynasty. Instead of recognizing the Phagmodru ruler,\
    \ the Hongwu Emperor sided with the Karmapa of the nearer Kham region and southeastern\
    \ Tibet, sending envoys out in the winter of 1372\u20131373 to ask the Yuan officeholders\
    \ to renew their titles for the new Ming court."
  question: Who did the Hongwu Emperor send convoys to?
- answer: by the filing of Articles of Incorporation or Articles of Association
  context: Canada allows nonprofits to be incorporated or unincorporated. Nonprofits
    may incorporate either federally, under Part II of the Canada Business Corporations
    Act or under provincial legislation. Many of the governing Acts for Canadian nonprofits
    date to the early 1900s, meaning that nonprofit legislation has not kept pace
    with legislation that governs for-profit corporations; particularly with regards
    to corporate governance. Federal, and in some provinces (such as Ontario), incorporation
    is by way of Letters Patent, and any change to the Letters Patent (even a simple
    name change) requires formal approval by the appropriate government, as do by-law
    changes. Other provinces (such as Alberta) permit incorporation as of right, by
    the filing of Articles of Incorporation or Articles of Association.
  question: How does Alberta handle NPOs filing for incorporation?
- answer: a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb
    these lost fluids
  context: Inflammatory diarrhea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining
    or brush border, which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased
    ability to absorb these lost fluids. Features of all three of the other types
    of diarrhea[clarification needed] can be found in this type of diarrhea. It can
    be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic infections, or
    autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases. It can also be caused
    by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and enteritis.[citation needed]
  question: What happens with inflammatory diarrhea?
- answer: blotter sheet
  context: Pressing the sheet removes the water by force; once the water is forced
    from the sheet, a special kind of felt, which is not to be confused with the traditional
    one, is used to collect the water; whereas when making paper by hand, a blotter
    sheet is used instead.
  question: What is used to collect water when hand-making paper?
- answer: Allied military governments
  context: 'During the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II, internal borders
    were redrawn by the Allied military governments. No single state comprised more
    than 30% of either population or territory; this was intended to prevent any one
    state from being as dominant within Germany as Prussia had been in the past. Initially,
    only seven of the pre-War states remained: Baden (in part), Bavaria (reduced in
    size), Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse (enlarged), Saxony, and Thuringia. The states with
    hyphenated names, such as Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Saxony-Anhalt,
    owed their existence to the occupation powers and were created out of mergers
    of former Prussian provinces and smaller states. Former German territory that
    lie east of the Oder-Neisse Line fell under either Polish or Soviet administration
    but attempts were made at least symbolically not to abandon sovereignty well into
    the 1960s. However, no attempts were made to establish new states in these territories
    as they lay outside the jurisdiction of West Germany at that time.'
  question: Who redrew Germany's internal borders after World War II?
- answer: capitalized
  context: "Czech typographical features not associated with phonetics generally resemble\
    \ those of most Latin European languages, including English. Proper nouns, honorifics,\
    \ and the first letters of quotations are capitalized, and punctuation is typical\
    \ of other Latin European languages. Writing of ordinal numerals is similar to\
    \ most European languages. The Czech language uses a decimal comma instead of\
    \ a decimal point. When writing a long number, spaces between every three numbers\
    \ (e.g. between hundreds and thousands) may be used for better orientation in\
    \ handwritten texts, but not in decimal places, like in English. The number 1,234,567.8910\
    \ may be written as 1234567,8910 or 1 234 567,8910. Ordinal numbers (1st) use\
    \ a point as in German (1.). In proper noun phrases (except personal names), only\
    \ the first word is capitalized (Pra\u017Esk\xFD hrad, Prague Castle)."
  question: In Czech, what is done to proper nouns, honorifics, and the first letters
    of quotations?
- answer: tea
  context: Kathmandu has a larger proportion of tea drinkers than coffee drinkers.
    Tea is widely served but is extremely weak by western standards. It is richer
    and contains tea leaves boiled with milk, sugar and spices. Alcohol is widely
    drunk, and there are numerous local variants of alcoholic beverages. Drinking
    and driving is illegal, and authorities have a zero tolerance policy. Ailaa and
    thwon (alcohol made from rice) are the alcoholic beverages of Kathmandu, found
    in all the local bhattis (alcohol serving eateries). Chhyaang, tongba (fermented
    millet or barley) and rakshi are alcoholic beverages from other parts of Nepal
    which are found in Kathmandu. However, shops and bars in Kathmandu widely sell
    western and Nepali beers.
  question: What beverage is consumed by more people in Kathmandu, coffee or tea?
- answer: left-wing Democratic Party
  context: Political color schemes in the United States diverge from international
    norms. Since 2000, red has become associated with the right-wing Republican Party
    and blue with the left-wing Democratic Party. However, unlike political color
    schemes of other countries, the parties did not choose those colors; they were
    used in news coverage of 2000 election results and ensuing legal battle and caught
    on in popular usage. Prior to the 2000 election the media typically alternated
    which color represented which party each presidential election cycle. The color
    scheme happened to get inordinate attention that year, so the cycle was stopped
    lest it cause confusion the following election.
  question: What political party is the color blue associated with?
- answer: a gold ring
  context: 'To symbolize their bond with the papacy, the pope gives each newly appointed
    cardinal a gold ring, which is traditionally kissed by Catholics when greeting
    a cardinal (as with a bishop''s episcopal ring). The pope chooses the image on
    the outside: under Pope Benedict XVI it was a modern depiction of the crucifixion
    of Jesus, with Mary and John to each side. The ring includes the pope''s coat
    of arms on the inside.[citation needed]'
  question: What does the pope give to a new Cardinal?
- answer: top 20 week
  context: Crystal Bowersox, who has Type-I diabetes, fell ill due to diabetic ketoacidosis
    on the morning of the girls performance night for the top 20 week and was hospitalized.
    The schedule was rearranged so the boys performed first and she could perform
    the following night instead; she later revealed that Ken Warwick, the show producer,
    wanted to disqualify her but she begged to be allowed to stay on the show.
  question: When was Crystal hospitalized?
- answer: Freeview HD
  context: The Freeview HD service currently contains 10 HD channels (as of December
    2013[update]) and was rolled out region by region across the UK in accordance
    with the digital switchover process, finally being completed in October 2012.
    However, Freeview HD is not the first HDTV service over digital terrestrial television
    in Europe;
  question: Which service contains 10 HD channels and finished its roll out in October
    2012?
- answer: four
  context: In the first major change to the judging panel, a fourth judge, Kara DioGuardi,
    was introduced. This was also the first season without executive producer Nigel
    Lythgoe who left to focus on the international versions of his show So You Think
    You Can Dance. The Hollywood round was moved to the Kodak Theatre for 2009 and
    was also extended to two weeks. Idol Gives Back was canceled for this season due
    to the global recession at the time.
  question: How many judges were on the panel for this season?
- answer: six
  context: Stone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the
    construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire
    of 1835. A distinctive feature of many of the city's buildings is the wooden roof-mounted
    water towers. In the 1800s, the city required their installation on buildings
    higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures
    at lower elevations, which could break municipal water pipes. Garden apartments
    became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas, such as Jackson Heights.
  question: In the 19th century, New York city required water towers in the roofs
    of buildings that were more than how many stories tall?
- answer: one mile and a half
  context: 'In his 1854 book "The Cruise of the Steam Yacht North Star" John Choules
    described Southampton thus: "I hardly know a town that can show a more beautiful
    Main Street than Southampton, except it be Oxford. The High Street opens from
    the quay, and under various names it winds in a gently sweeping line for one mile
    and a half, and is of very handsome width. The variety of style and color of material
    in the buildings affords an exhibition of outline, light and color, that I think
    is seldom equalled. The shops are very elegant, and the streets are kept exceedingly
    clean."'
  question: How long was Southampton's High Street as described by Choules?
- answer: Guinea (formerly French Guinea)
  context: Guinea-Bissau was once part of the kingdom of Gabu, as well as part of
    the Mali Empire. Parts of this kingdom persisted until the 18th century, while
    a few others were under some rule by the Portuguese Empire since the 16th century.
    In the 19th century, it was colonized as Portuguese Guinea. Upon independence,
    declared in 1973 and recognised in 1974, the name of its capital, Bissau, was
    added to the country's name to prevent confusion with Guinea (formerly French
    Guinea). Guinea-Bissau has a history of political instability since independence,
    and no elected president has successfully served a full five-year term.
  question: What country did Guinea-Bissau seek to differentiate itself from?
- answer: WUOM 91.7
  context: Four major AM radio stations based in or near Ann Arbor are WAAM 1600,
    a conservative news and talk station; WLBY 1290, a business news and talk station;
    WDEO 990, Catholic radio; and WTKA 1050, which is primarily a sports station.
    The city's FM stations include NPR affiliate WUOM 91.7; country station WWWW 102.9;
    and adult-alternative station WQKL 107.1. Freeform station WCBN-FM 88.3 is a local
    community radio/college radio station operated by the students of the University
    of Michigan featuring noncommercial, eclectic music and public-affairs programming.
    The city is also served by public and commercial radio broadcasters in Ypsilanti,
    the Lansing/Jackson area, Detroit, Windsor, and Toledo.
  question: What is the name of the city's FM radio channel?
- answer: Labour and Irish Nationalist members.
  context: The Edwardian era in the United Kingdom is the period spanning the reign
    of King Edward VII up to the end of the First World War, including the years surrounding
    the sinking of the RMS Titanic. In the early years of the period, the Second Boer
    War in South Africa split the country into anti- and pro-war factions. The imperial
    policies of the Conservatives eventually proved unpopular and in the general election
    of 1906 the Liberals won a huge landslide. The Liberal government was unable to
    proceed with all of its radical programme without the support of the House of
    Lords, which was largely Conservative. Conflict between the two Houses of Parliament
    over the People's Budget led to a reduction in the power of the peers in 1910.
    The general election in January that year returned a hung parliament with the
    balance of power held by Labour and Irish Nationalist members.
  question: Who held the balance of power in the 1910 election?
- answer: Christians
  context: Most Greeks are Christians, belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church. During
    the first centuries after Jesus Christ, the New Testament was originally written
    in Koine Greek, which remains the liturgical language of the Greek Orthodox Church,
    and most of the early Christians and Church Fathers were Greek-speaking. There
    are small groups of ethnic Greeks adhering to other Christian denominations like
    Greek Catholics, Greek Evangelicals, Pentecostals, and groups adhering to other
    religions including Romaniot and Sephardic Jews and Greek Muslims. About 2,000
    Greeks are members of Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism congregations.
  question: What is the religion of the Greek majority ?
- answer: monophonic
  context: Native American music in North America is almost entirely monophonic, but
    there are notable exceptions. Traditional Native American music often centers
    around drumming. Rattles, clappersticks, and rasps were also popular percussive
    instruments. Flutes were made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The tuning
    of these flutes is not precise and depends on the length of the wood used and
    the hand span of the intended player, but the finger holes are most often around
    a whole step apart and, at least in Northern California, a flute was not used
    if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step. The Apache fiddle is
    a single stringed instrument.
  question: What characteristic did the majority of Native American music have?
- answer: digital
  context: MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is
    an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression.
    It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as
    a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback
    of music on most digital audio players.
  question: What kind of audio is the coding format for?
- answer: intellectual movements
  context: Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value
    and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers
    critical thinking and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over acceptance of dogma
    or superstition. The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated according to
    the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it. Generally,
    however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human freedom
    and progress. In modern times, humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism,
    and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human
    agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source
    to understand the world.
  question: What can be credited for the changes in the definition of humanism?
- answer: consequences of a free massless spin 2 field
  context: "After the success of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman turned to quantum\
    \ gravity. By analogy with the photon, which has spin 1, he investigated the consequences\
    \ of a free massless spin 2 field, and derived the Einstein field equation of\
    \ general relativity, but little more. The computational device that Feynman discovered\
    \ then for gravity, \"ghosts\", which are \"particles\" in the interior of his\
    \ diagrams that have the \"wrong\" connection between spin and statistics, have\
    \ proved invaluable in explaining the quantum particle behavior of the Yang\u2013\
    Mills theories, for example, QCD and the electro-weak theory."
  question: What did Feynman investigate while working on quantum gravity?
- answer: R&B and soul music
  context: The urban AC stations resemble soft AC rather than hot AC; they play predominantly
    R&B and soul music with little hip-hop. This is reflected in many of the urban
    AC radio stations' taglines, such as "Today's R&B and classic soul", "The best
    variety of R&B hits and oldies" and "(City/Region)'s R&B leader". Urban AC's core
    artists include Luther Vandross, Trey Songz, Patti LaBelle, Toni Braxton, Whitney
    Houston, Aretha Franklin, Frank Ocean, Craig David and Mariah Carey.
  question: What two genres of music are popular on urban AC?
- answer: Sammy Hagar
  context: "Bon Jovi's third album, Slippery When Wet (1986), mixed hard rock with\
    \ a pop sensitivity and spent a total of 8 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200\
    \ album chart, selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard\
    \ rock album to spawn three top 10 singles \u2014 two of which reached number\
    \ one. The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre,\
    \ particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated\
    \ audience, and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands\
    \ at the end of the decade. The anthemic The Final Countdown (1986) by Swedish\
    \ group Europe was an international hit, reaching number eight on the US charts\
    \ while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries. This era also saw more glam-infused\
    \ American hard rock bands come to the forefront, with both Poison and Cinderella\
    \ releasing their multi-platinum d\xE9but albums in 1986. Van Halen released 5150\
    \ (1986), their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number\
    \ one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies. By the second\
    \ half of the decade, hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial\
    \ popular music in the United States."
  question: Who was the new lead singer for Van Halen on 5150?
- answer: Todai-ji and Kofuku-ji
  context: Taira Kiyomori emerged as the real power in Japan following the Minamoto's
    destruction, and he would remain in command for the next 20 years. He gave his
    daughter Tokuko in marriage to the young emperor Takakura, who died at only 19,
    leaving their infant son Antoku to succeed to the throne. Kiyomori filled no less
    than 50 government posts with his relatives, rebuilt the Inland Sea, and encouraged
    trade with Sung China. He also took aggressive actions to safeguard his power
    when necessary, including the removal and exile of 45 court officials and the
    razing of two troublesome temples, Todai-ji and Kofuku-ji.
  question: What were the names of the temples that Kiyomori destroyed?
- answer: hyperarid
  context: "The central part of the Sahara is hyperarid, with little to no vegetation.\
    \ The northern and southern reaches of the desert, along with the highlands, have\
    \ areas of sparse grassland and desert shrub, with trees and taller shrubs in\
    \ wadis where moisture collects. In the central, hyperarid part, there are many\
    \ subdivisions of the great desert such as the Tanezrouft, the T\xE9n\xE9r\xE9\
    , the Libyan Desert, the Eastern Desert, the Nubian Desert and others. These absolute\
    \ desert regions are characterized by their extreme aridity, and some years can\
    \ pass without any rainfall."
  question: What is the central part of the Sahara Desert?
- answer: ICBMs
  context: The interceptor aircraft (or simply interceptor) is a type of fighter aircraft
    designed specifically to intercept and destroy enemy aircraft, particularly bombers,
    usually relying on high speed and altitude capabilities. A number of jet interceptors
    such as the F-102 Delta Dagger, the F-106 Delta Dart, and the MiG-25 were built
    in the period starting after the end of World War II and ending in the late 1960s,
    when they became less important due to the shifting of the strategic bombing role
    to ICBMs. Invariably the type is differentiated from other fighter aircraft designs
    by higher speeds and shorter operating ranges, as well as much reduced ordnance
    payloads.
  question: The interceptors were no longer built because of the shift of the bombing
    role to what?
- answer: Kilbarry Railway Station
  context: The Cork Suburban Rail system also departs from Kent Station and provides
    connections to parts of Metropolitan Cork. Stations include Little Island, Mallow,
    Midleton, Fota and Cobh. In July 2009 the Glounthaune to Midleton line was reopened,
    with new stations at Carrigtwohill and Midleton (with future stations planned
    for Kilbarry, Monard, Carrigtwohill West and Blarney). Little Island Railway Station
    serves Cork's Eastern Suburbs, while Kilbarry Railway Station is planned to serve
    the Northern Suburbs.
  question: What station is going to be available to the Northern Suburbs?
- answer: 158.8 million
  context: "Her first acting role of 2006 was in the comedy film The Pink Panther\
    \ starring opposite Steve Martin, grossing $158.8 million at the box office worldwide.\
    \ Her second film Dreamgirls, the film version of the 1981 Broadway musical loosely\
    \ based on The Supremes, received acclaim from critics and grossed $154 million\
    \ internationally. In it, she starred opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, and\
    \ Eddie Murphy playing a pop singer based on Diana Ross. To promote the film,\
    \ Beyonc\xE9 released \"Listen\" as the lead single from the soundtrack album.\
    \ In April 2007, Beyonc\xE9 embarked on The Beyonc\xE9 Experience, her first worldwide\
    \ concert tour, visiting 97 venues and grossed over $24 million.[note 1] Beyonc\xE9\
    \ conducted pre-concert food donation drives during six major stops in conjunction\
    \ with her pastor at St. John's and America's Second Harvest. At the same time,\
    \ B'Day was re-released with five additional songs, including her duet with Shakira\
    \ \"Beautiful Liar\"."
  question: How many millions of dollars did ''The Pink Panther'' gross world-wide?
- answer: craton Baltica collided with the terrane Avalonia
  context: "The British Isles lie at the juncture of several regions with past episodes\
    \ of tectonic mountain building. These orogenic belts form a complex geology that\
    \ records a huge and varied span of Earth's history. Of particular note was the\
    \ Caledonian Orogeny during the Ordovician Period, c. 488\u2013444 Ma and early\
    \ Silurian period, when the craton Baltica collided with the terrane Avalonia\
    \ to form the mountains and hills in northern Britain and Ireland. Baltica formed\
    \ roughly the northwestern half of Ireland and Scotland. Further collisions caused\
    \ the Variscan orogeny in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, forming the\
    \ hills of Munster, southwest England, and southern Wales. Over the last 500 million\
    \ years the land that forms the islands has drifted northwest from around 30\xB0\
    S, crossing the equator around 370 million years ago to reach its present northern\
    \ latitude."
  question: "What happened during the c. 488\u2013444 Ma and early Silurian period?"
- answer: geography, coupled with the superiority of the British navy, made it difficult
  context: 'For much of the eighteenth century, France approached its wars in the
    same way. It would let colonies defend themselves or would offer only minimal
    help (sending them limited numbers of troops or inexperienced soldiers), anticipating
    that fights for the colonies would most likely be lost anyway. This strategy was
    to a degree forced upon France: geography, coupled with the superiority of the
    British navy, made it difficult for the French navy to provide significant supplies
    and support to French colonies. Similarly, several long land borders made an effective
    domestic army imperative for any French ruler. Given these military necessities,
    the French government, unsurprisingly, based its strategy overwhelmingly on the
    army in Europe: it would keep most of its army on the continent, hoping for victories
    closer to home. The plan was to fight to the end of hostilities and then, in treaty
    negotiations, to trade territorial acquisitions in Europe to regain lost overseas
    possessions. This approach did not serve France well in the war, as the colonies
    were indeed lost, but although much of the European war went well, by its end
    France had few counterbalancing European successes.'
  question: Identify a major factor in this feckless strategy by France of not defending
    its colonies with enthusiasm?
- answer: the Arabian Peninsula
  context: The culture of Somalia is an amalgamation of traditions developed independently
    and through interaction with neighbouring and far away civilizations, such as
    other parts of Northeast Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, India and Southeast Asia.
  question: Along with Northeast Africa, Southeast Asia and India, what locale had
    a significant influence on Somali culture?
- answer: 1,700 km2
  context: "In 1854 president Antonio L\xF3pez de Santa Anna enlarged the area of\
    \ the Federal District almost eightfold from the original 220 to 1,700 km2 (80\
    \ to 660 sq mi), annexing the rural and mountainous areas to secure the strategic\
    \ mountain passes to the south and southwest to protect the city in event of a\
    \ foreign invasion. (The Mexican\u2013American War had just been fought.) The\
    \ last changes to the limits of the Federal District were made between 1898 and\
    \ 1902, reducing the area to the current 1,479 km2 (571 sq mi) by adjusting the\
    \ southern border with the state of Morelos. By that time, the total number of\
    \ municipalities within the Federal District was twenty-two."
  question: How large was Mexico City at its largest?
- answer: council-manager
  context: 'Ann Arbor has a council-manager form of government. The City Council has
    11 voting members: the mayor and 10 city council members. The mayor and city council
    members serve two-year terms: the mayor is elected every even-numbered year, while
    half of the city council members are up for election annually (five in even-numbered
    and five in odd-numbered years). Two council members are elected from each of
    the city''s five wards. The mayor is elected citywide. The mayor is the presiding
    officer of the City Council and has the power to appoint all Council committee
    members as well as board and commission members, with the approval of the City
    Council. The current mayor of Ann Arbor is Christopher Taylor, a Democrat who
    was elected as mayor in 2014. Day-to-day city operations are managed by a city
    administrator chosen by the city council.'
  question: What form of government does Ann Arbor have?
- answer: cross-cultural
  context: Building Partnerships is described as airmen interacting with international
    airmen and other relevant actors to develop, guide, and sustain relationships
    for mutual benefit and security. Building Partnerships is about interacting with
    others and is therefore an inherently inter-personal and cross-cultural undertaking.
    Through both words and deeds, the majority of interaction is devoted to building
    trust-based relationships for mutual benefit. It includes both foreign partners
    as well as domestic partners and emphasizes collaboration with foreign governments,
    militaries and populations as well as US government departments, agencies, industry,
    and NGOs. To better facilitate partnering efforts, Airmen should be competent
    in the relevant language, region, and culture.
  question: What sort of inter-personal relationships does Building Partnerships encourage?
- answer: derelict industrial environments
  context: "In the mid 1970s, various American groups (some with ties to Downtown\
    \ Manhattan's punk scene, including Television and Suicide) had begun expanding\
    \ on the vocabulary of punk music. Midwestern groups such as Pere Ubu and Devo\
    \ drew inspiration from the region's derelict industrial environments, employing\
    \ conceptual art techniques, musique concr\xE8te and unconventional verbal styles\
    \ that would presage the post-punk movement by several years. A variety of subsequent\
    \ groups, including New York-based Talking Heads and Boston-based Mission of Burma,\
    \ combined elements of punk with art school sensibilities. In 1978, the former\
    \ band began a series of collaborations with British ambient pioneer and ex-Roxy\
    \ Music member Brian Eno, experimenting with Dada-influenced lyrical techniques,\
    \ dance music, and African polyrhythms. San Francisco's vibrant post-punk scene\
    \ was centered around such groups as Chrome, the Residents and Tuxedomoon, who\
    \ incorporated multimedia experimentation, film and ideas from Antonin Artaud's\
    \ Theater of Cruelty."
  question: What did Pere and Devo draw inspiration for their music from?
- answer: '2011'
  context: The top ten best-selling drugs of 2013 totaled $75.6 billion in sales,
    with the anti-inflammatory drug Humira being the best-selling drug worldwide at
    $10.7 billion in sales. The second and third best selling were Enbrel and Remicade,
    respectively. The top three best-selling drugs in the United States in 2013 were
    Abilify ($6.3 billion,) Nexium ($6 billion) and Humira ($5.4 billion). The best-selling
    drug ever, Lipitor, averaged $13 billion annually and netted $141 billion total
    over its lifetime before Pfizer's patent expired in November 2011.
  question: In what year did Pfizer's patent over Lipitor expire?
- answer: four
  context: "The wildcard round returned in season eight, wherein there were three\
    \ groups of twelve, with three contestants moving forward \u2013 the highest male,\
    \ the highest female, and the next highest-placed singer - for each night, and\

- answer: Ice Q Restaurant
  context: "Filming started in Austria in December 2014, with production taking in\
    \ the area around S\xF6lden\u2014including the \xD6tztal Glacier Road, Rettenbach\
    \ glacier and the adjacent ski resort and cable car station\u2014and Obertilliach\

    \ that saw three crew members injured, at least one of them seriously."
  question: What location was the focus of the Austrian leg of Spectre's production?
- answer: hunting
  context: While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters, the importance of
    this for the emergence of the Homo genus from the earlier Australopithecines,
    including the production of stone tools and eventually the control of fire, are
    emphasised in the hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress
    omnivory and social interaction, including mating behaviour, as essential in the
    emergence of human behavioural modernity. With the establishment of language,
    culture, and religion, hunting became a theme of stories and myths, as well as
    rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice.
  question: What became a theme of stories and myths?
- answer: '20'
  context: Labour improved its performance in 1987, gaining 20 seats and so reducing
    the Conservative majority from 143 to 102. They were now firmly re-established
    as the second political party in Britain as the Alliance had once again failed
    to make a breakthrough with seats. A merger of the SDP and Liberals formed the
    Liberal Democrats. Following the 1987 election, the National Executive Committee
    resumed disciplinary action against members of Militant, who remained in the party,
    leading to further expulsions of their activists and the two MPs who supported
    the group.
  question: How many more seats did LAbour get in 1987?

  context: "The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central\
    \ part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio central), located\
    \ in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries.\
    \ It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the\
    \ country, founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the\
    \ Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans,\

  question: What is the largest cemetery?
- answer: '1934'
  context: "Chapultepec Park houses the Chapultepec Castle, now a museum on a hill\
    \ that overlooks the park and its numerous museums, monuments and the national\
    \ zoo and the National Museum of Anthropology (which houses the Aztec Calendar\
    \ Stone). Another piece of architecture is the Fine Arts Palace, a white marble\
    \ theatre/museum whose weight is such that it has gradually been sinking into\
    \ the soft ground below. Its construction began during the presidency of Porfirio\
    \ D\xEDaz and ended in 1934, after being interrupted by the Mexican Revolution\
    \ in the 1920s. The Plaza of the Three Cultures in the Tlatelolco neighbourhood,\

  question: When did construction of the Fine Arts Palace end?
- answer: George W. Bush
  context: 'West has been an outspoken and controversial celebrity throughout his
    career, receiving both criticism and praise from many, including the mainstream
    media, other artists and entertainers, and two U.S. presidents. On September 2,
    2005, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief on NBC, A Concert
    for Hurricane Relief, West (a featured speaker) accused President George W. Bush
    of not "car[ing] about black people". When West was presenting alongside actor
    Mike Myers, he deviated from the prepared script to criticize the media''s portrayal
    of hurricane victims, saying:'
  question: Which President did Kanye West accuse of "Not caring for black people"?
- answer: press
  context: Multi-layer printed circuit boards have trace layers inside the board.
    This is achieved by laminating a stack of materials in a press by applying pressure
    and heat for a period of time. This results in an inseparable one piece product.
    For example, a four-layer PCB can be fabricated by starting from a two-sided copper-clad
    laminate, etch the circuitry on both sides, then laminate to the top and bottom
    pre-preg and copper foil. It is then drilled, plated, and etched again to get
    traces on top and bottom layers.
  question: What tool is used to push the trace layers in a multi-layer PCB together?
- answer: to avoid breaching sovereignty through military invasion
  context: The use of drones by the Central Intelligence Agency in Pakistan to carry
    out operations associated with the Global War on Terror sparks debate over sovereignty
    and the laws of war. The U.S. Government uses the CIA rather than the U.S. Air
    Force for strikes in Pakistan in order to avoid breaching sovereignty through
    military invasion. The United States was criticized by[according to whom?] a report
    on drone warfare and aerial sovereignty for abusing the term 'Global War on Terror'
    to carry out military operations through government agencies without formally
    declaring war.
  question: Why did the US use the CIA instead of the Air Force to run drones?
- answer: The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states
    emerged
  context: "Early civilisations in Myanmar included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu\
    \ city-states in Upper Burma and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Burma. In the 9th century,\
    \ the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and, following the establishment\
    \ of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s, the Burmese language, culture and Theravada\
    \ Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country. The Pagan Kingdom fell due to\
    \ the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century,\
    \ reunified by the Taungoo Dynasty, the country was for a brief period the largest\
    \ empire in the history of Southeast Asia. The early 19th century Konbaung Dynasty\
    \ ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur\
    \ and Assam as well. The British conquered Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars\
    \ in the 19th century and the country became a British colony. Myanmar became\
    \ an independent nation in 1948, initially as a democratic nation and then, following\
    \ a coup d'\xE9tat in 1962, a military dictatorship."
  question: What caused the downfall of the downfall of the the original kingdom in
    Myanmar?
- answer: the 1998 Russian financial crisis
  context: In 1999, Estonia experienced its worst year economically since it regained
    independence in 1991, largely because of the impact of the 1998 Russian financial
    crisis.[citation needed] Estonia joined the WTO in November 1999. With assistance
    from the European Union, the World Bank and the Nordic Investment Bank, Estonia
    completed most of its preparations for European Union membership by the end of
    2002 and now has one of the strongest economies of the new member states of the
    European Union.[citation needed] Estonia joined the OECD in 2010.
  question: What event played a major part in the decline of the economy during 1999?
- answer: The FBI refused
  context: "In 2005, fugitive Puerto Rican Nationalist leader Filiberto Ojeda R\xED\
    os died in a gun battle with FBI agents in 2005 in what some charged was an assassination.[citation\
    \ needed] Puerto Rico Governor An\xEDbal Acevedo Vil\xE1 criticized the FBI assault\
    \ as \"improper\" and \"highly irregular\" and demanded to know why his government\
    \ was not informed of it. The FBI refused to release information beyond the official\
    \ press release, citing security and agent privacy issues. The Puerto Rico Justice\
    \ Department filed suit in federal court against the FBI and the US Attorney General,\
    \ demanding information crucial to the Commonwealth's own investigation of the\
    \ incident. The case was dismissed by the U.S Supreme Court. Ojeda Rios' funeral\
    \ was attended by a long list of dignitaries, including the highest authority\
    \ of the Roman Catholic Church in Puerto Rico, Archbishop Roberto Octavio Gonz\xE1\
    lez Nieves, ex-Governor Rafael Hern\xE1ndez Col\xF3n, and numerous other personalities."
  question: How did the FBI respond to requests to release information beyond the
    initial press release?
- answer: leeches
  context: Except for a few primitive organisms such as sponges (which have no nervous
    system) and cnidarians (which have a nervous system consisting of a diffuse nerve
    net), all living multicellular animals are bilaterians, meaning animals with a
    bilaterally symmetric body shape (that is, left and right sides that are approximate
    mirror images of each other). All bilaterians are thought to have descended from
    a common ancestor that appeared early in the Cambrian period, 485-540 million
    years ago, and it has been hypothesized that this common ancestor had the shape
    of a simple tubeworm with a segmented body. At a schematic level, that basic worm-shape
    continues to be reflected in the body and nervous system architecture of all modern
    bilaterians, including vertebrates. The fundamental bilateral body form is a tube
    with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus, and a nerve cord
    with an enlargement (a ganglion) for each body segment, with an especially large
    ganglion at the front, called the brain. The brain is small and simple in some
    species, such as nematode worms; in other species, including vertebrates, it is
    the most complex organ in the body. Some types of worms, such as leeches, also
    have an enlarged ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord, known as a "tail
    brain".
  question: What type of creature has a ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord
    as well?
- answer: approximately 3,000 EJ per year
  context: The total solar energy absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, oceans and land
    masses is approximately 3,850,000 exajoules (EJ) per year. In 2002, this was more
    energy in one hour than the world used in one year. Photosynthesis captures approximately
    3,000 EJ per year in biomass. The amount of solar energy reaching the surface
    of the planet is so vast that in one year it is about twice as much as will ever
    be obtained from all of the Earth's non-renewable resources of coal, oil, natural
    gas, and mined uranium combined,
  question: How much solar energy is captured by photosynthesis?
- answer: Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of intelligence and human
    speech
  context: "Digimon hatch from types of eggs which are called Digi-Eggs (\u30C7\u30B8\
    \u30BF\u30DE, Dejitama?). In the English iterations of the franchise there is\
    \ another type of Digi-Egg that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon.\
    \ This second type of Digi-Egg is called a Digimental (\u30C7\u30B8\u30E1\u30F3\
    \u30BF\u30EB, Dejimentaru?) in Japanese. (This type of Digi-Egg was also featured\
    \ as a major object throughout season 2 as a way of Digivolution available only\
    \ to certain characters at certain points throughout the season.) They age via\
    \ a process called \"Digivolution\" which changes their appearance and increases\
    \ their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner\
    \ Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved\
    \ will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they\
    \ are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable\
    \ of intelligence and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices\
    \ that their human partners have. In some cases, as in the first series, the DigiDestined\
    \ (known as the 'Chosen Children' in the original Japanese) had to find some special\
    \ items such as crests and tags so the Digimon could digivolve into further stages\
    \ of evolution known as Ultimate and Mega in the dub."
  question: Are digimon all mindless monsters?
- answer: 4004 BC
  context: "The Protestant Reformation inspired a literal interpretation of the Bible,\
    \ with concepts of creation that conflicted with the findings of an emerging science\
    \ seeking explanations congruent with the mechanical philosophy of Ren\xE9 Descartes\
    \ and the empiricism of the Baconian method. After the turmoil of the English\
    \ Civil War, the Royal Society wanted to show that science did not threaten religious\
    \ and political stability. John Ray developed an influential natural theology\
    \ of rational order; in his taxonomy, species were static and fixed, their adaptation\
    \ and complexity designed by God, and varieties showed minor differences caused\
    \ by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully\
    \ swift death, but the suffering caused by parasitism was a puzzling problem.\
    \ The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed\
    \ species as fixed according to the divine plan. In 1766, Georges Buffon suggested\
    \ that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards,\
    \ might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The Ussher chronology of\
    \ the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004 BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed\
    \ a much older world. Wernerians thought strata were deposits from shrinking seas,\
    \ but James Hutton proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating uniformitarianism."
  question: When did the Ussher chronology state that creation began?
- answer: 22 percent
  context: By the end of 2011, total renewable power capacity worldwide exceeded 1,360
    GW, up 8%. Renewables producing electricity accounted for almost half of the 208
    GW of capacity added globally during 2011. Wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) accounted
    for almost 40% and 30% . Based on REN21's 2014 report, renewables contributed
    19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation
    in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming
    from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity
    and 2% electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass.
  question: Renewables contributed what percentage to our electricity generation?
- answer: change their legal name
  context: An individual wrestler may sometimes use their real name, or a minor variation
    of it, for much of their career, such as Angelo Poffo, Ernie Ladd, Verne Gagne,
    Bret Hart, and Randy Orton. Others can keep one ring name for their entire career
    (cases in point include Chris Jericho, Shawn Michaels, CM Punk and Ricky Steamboat),
    or may change from time to time to better suit the demands of the audience or
    company. Sometimes a character is owned and trademarked by the company, forcing
    the wrestler to find a new one when they leave (although a simple typeset change,
    such as changing Rhyno to Rhino, can usually get around this), and sometimes a
    character is owned by the wrestler. Sometimes, a wrestler may change their legal
    name in order to obtain ownership of their ring name (examples include Andrew
    Martin and Warrior). Many wrestlers (such as The Rock and The Undertaker) are
    strongly identified with their character, even responding to the name in public
    or between friends. It's actually considered proper decorum for fellow wrestlers
    to refer to each other by their stage names/characters rather than their birth/legal
    names, unless otherwise introduced. A professional wrestling character's popularity
    can grow to the point that it makes appearances in other media (see Hulk Hogan
    and El Santo) or even give the performer enough visibility to enter politics (Antonio
    Inoki and Jesse Ventura, among others).
  question: What else might a wrestler do to obtain their ring name?
- answer: the Bourbon regime
  context: "Widespread rumors of Napoleon's return from St. Helena and Napoleon as\
    \ an inspiration for patriotism, individual and collective liberties, and political\
    \ mobilization manifested themselves in seditious materials, displaying the tricolor\
    \ and rosettes. There were also subversive activities celebrating anniversaries\
    \ of Napoleon's life and reign and disrupting royal celebrations\u2014they demonstrated\
    \ the prevailing and successful goal of the varied supporters of Napoleon to constantly\
    \ destabilize the Bourbon regime."
  question: Destabilization of what regime was the main goal of Napoleon's followers?
- answer: Gustav Sauf
  context: "Erich Koch headed the East Prussian Nazi party from 1928. He led the district\
    \ from 1932. This period was characterized by efforts to collectivize the local\
    \ agriculture and ruthlessness in dealing with his critics inside and outside\
    \ the Party. He also had long-term plans for mass-scale industrialization of the\
    \ largely agricultural province. These actions made him unpopular among the local\
    \ peasants. In 1932 the local paramilitary SA had already started to terrorise\
    \ their political opponents. On the night of 31 July 1932 there was a bomb attack\
    \ on the headquarters of the Social Democrats in K\xF6nigsberg, the Otto-Braun-House.\
    \ The Communist politician Gustav Sauf was killed; the executive editor of the\
    \ Social Democrat \"K\xF6nigsberger Volkszeitung\", Otto Wyrgatsch, and the German\
    \ People's Party politician Max von Bahrfeldt were severely injured. Members of\
    \ the Reichsbanner were attacked and the local Reichsbanner Chairman of L\xF6\
    tzen, Kurt Kotzan, was murdered on 6 August 1932."
  question: Who was killed in the attack of the Social Democrats?
- answer: a standard container format
  context: A "tag" in an audio file is a section of the file that contains metadata
    such as the title, artist, album, track number or other information about the
    file's contents. The MP3 standards do not define tag formats for MP3 files, nor
    is there a standard container format that would support metadata and obviate the
    need for tags.
  question: What would be needed to support metadata and obviate the need for tags?
- answer: the Roman Catholic Church
  context: The denomination with the longest history of objection to Freemasonry is
    the Roman Catholic Church. The objections raised by the Roman Catholic Church
    are based on the allegation that Masonry teaches a naturalistic deistic religion
    which is in conflict with Church doctrine. A number of Papal pronouncements have
    been issued against Freemasonry. The first was Pope Clement XII's In eminenti
    apostolatus, 28 April 1738; the most recent was Pope Leo XIII's Ab apostolici,
    15 October 1890. The 1917 Code of Canon Law explicitly declared that joining Freemasonry
    entailed automatic excommunication, and banned books favouring Freemasonry.
  question: Who has the longest history of objection to Freemasonry?
- answer: Slavic mercenaries fighting for the Byzantines and Arabs settled Asia Minor
    and even as far as Syria.
  context: Slavs are the largest Indo-European ethno-linguistic group in Europe. They
    inhabit Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southeast Europe, North Asia and Central
    Asia. Slavs speak Indo-European Slavic languages and share, to varying degrees,
    some cultural traits and historical backgrounds. From the early 6th century they
    spread to inhabit most of Central and Eastern Europe and Southeast Europe, whilst
    Slavic mercenaries fighting for the Byzantines and Arabs settled Asia Minor and
    even as far as Syria. The East Slavs colonised Siberia and Central Asia.[better
    source needed] Presently over half of Europe's territory is inhabited by Slavic-speaking
    communities, but every Slavic ethnicity has emigrated to other continents.
  question: Slavic mercenaries settled where?
- answer: animal fat
  context: 'Comparing diets among Western countries, researchers have discovered that
    although the French tend to eat higher levels of animal fat, the incidence of
    heart disease remains low in France. This phenomenon has been termed the French
    paradox, and is thought to occur from protective benefits of regularly consuming
    red wine. Apart from potential benefits of alcohol itself, including reduced platelet
    aggregation and vasodilation, polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol) mainly in the grape
    skin provide other suspected health benefits, such as:'
  question: What do people in France eat more of that in most western countries?
- answer: The Liber Census Daniae
  context: The Estonian literature refers to literature written in the Estonian language
    (ca. 1 million speakers). The domination of Estonia after the Northern Crusades,
    from the 13th century to 1918 by Germany, Sweden, and Russia resulted in few early
    written literary works in the Estonian language. The oldest records of written
    Estonian date from the 13th century. Originates Livoniae in Chronicle of Henry
    of Livonia contains Estonian place names, words and fragments of sentences. The
    Liber Census Daniae (1241) contains Estonian place and family names.
  question: What document dated in 1241 contains place and family names?
- answer: a reorganization of the army
  context: Albrecht von Roon, the Prussian Minister of War from 1859 to 1873, put
    into effect a series of reforms of the Prussian military system in the 1860s.
    Among these were two major reforms that substantially increased the military power
    of Germany. The first was a reorganization of the army that integrated the regular
    army and the Landwehr reserves. The second was the provision for the conscription
    of every male Prussian of military age in the event of mobilization. Thus, despite
    the population of France being greater than the population of all of the German
    states that participated in the war, the Germans mobilized more soldiers for battle.
  question: What was the first step in the reforms?
- answer: crafty, lazy, and careless
  context: "The first post-Classical published classification of humans into distinct\
    \ races seems to be Fran\xE7ois Bernier's Nouvelle division de la terre par les\
    \ diff\xE9rents esp\xE8ces ou races qui l'habitent (\"New division of Earth by\
    \ the different species or races which inhabit it\"), published in 1684. In the\
    \ 18th century the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific\
    \ investigation. But the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was\
    \ frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different\
    \ groups, always attributing the most desirable features to the White, European\
    \ race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable\
    \ attributes. The 1735 classification of Carl Linnaeus, inventor of zoological\
    \ taxonomy, divided the human race Homo sapiens into continental varieties of\
    \ europaeus, asiaticus, americanus, and afer, each associated with a different\
    \ humour: sanguine, melancholic, choleric, and phlegmatic, respectively. Homo\
    \ sapiens europaeus was described as active, acute, and adventurous, whereas Homo\
    \ sapiens afer was said to be crafty, lazy, and careless."
  question: What attributes were bestowed on homo spaiens afer?
- answer: funding assistance
  context: The United Nations designates Tuvalu as a least developed country (LDC)
    because of its limited potential for economic development, absence of exploitable
    resources and its small size and vulnerability to external economic and environmental
    shocks. Tuvalu participates in the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related
    Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries (EIF), which was established
    in October 1997 under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation. In 2013 Tuvalu
    deferred its graduation from least developed country (LDC) status to a developing
    country to 2015. Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said that this deferral was necessary
    to maintain access by Tuvalu to the funds provided by the United Nations's National
    Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), as "Once Tuvalu graduates to a developed
    country, it will not be considered for funding assistance for climate change adaptation
    programmes like NAPA, which only goes to LDCs". Tuvalu had met targets so that
    Tuvalu was to graduate from LDC status. Prime minister, Enele Sopoaga wants the
    United Nations to reconsider its criteria for graduation from LDC status as not
    enough weight is given to the environmental plight of small island states like
    Tuvalu in the application of the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI).
  question: What would Tuvalu have lost as a developed country?
- answer: literal, conservative
  context: "On the other hand, in his study on nine of \"the Bibles most widely in\
    \ use in the English-speaking world\", Bible scholar Jason BeDuhn, Professor of\
    \ Religious Studies at the Northern Arizona University, wrote: \u201CThe NW [New\
    \ World Translation] emerges as the most accurate of the translations compared.\u201D\
    \ Although the general public and many Bible scholars assume that the differences\
    \ in the New World Translation are the result of religious bias on the part of\
    \ its translators, BeDuhn stated: \u201CMost of the differences are due to the\
    \ greater accuracy of the NW as a literal, conservative translation of the original\
    \ expressions of the New Testament writers.\u201D He added however that the insertion\
    \ of the name Jehovah in the New Testament \"violate[s] accuracy in favor of denominationally\
    \ preferred expressions for God\"."
  question: The NW often errs on the side of what type of translation?
- answer: the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors
  context: "Under the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the Nanjing area was known as\
    \ Jiangning (\u6C5F\u5BE7) and served as the seat of government for the Viceroy\
    \ of Liangjiang. It had been visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors a number\
    \ of times on their tours of the southern provinces. Nanjing was invaded by British\
    \ troops during the close of the First Opium War, which was ended by the Treaty\
    \ of Nanjing in 1842. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel Taiping Heavenly\
    \ Kingdom (founded by the Taiping rebels in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was\
    \ known as Tianjing (\u5929\u4EAC, \"Heavenly Capital\" or \"Capital of Heaven\"\

  question: What emperors visited Nanjing more than once?
- answer: May 1200
  context: After his coronation, John moved south into France with military forces
    and adopted a defensive posture along the eastern and southern Normandy borders.
    Both sides paused for desultory negotiations before the war recommenced; John's
    position was now stronger, thanks to confirmation that the counts Baldwin IX of
    Flanders and Renaud of Boulogne had renewed the anti-French alliances they had
    previously agreed to with Richard. The powerful Anjou nobleman William des Roches
    was persuaded to switch sides from Arthur to John; suddenly the balance seemed
    to be tipping away from Philip and Arthur in favour of John. Neither side was
    keen to continue the conflict, and following a papal truce the two leaders met
    in January 1200 to negotiate possible terms for peace. From John's perspective,
    what then followed represented an opportunity to stabilise control over his continental
    possessions and produce a lasting peace with Philip in Paris. John and Philip
    negotiated the May 1200 Treaty of Le Goulet; by this treaty, Philip recognised
    John as the rightful heir to Richard in respect to his French possessions, temporarily
    abandoning the wider claims of his client, Arthur.[nb 4] John, in turn, abandoned
    Richard's former policy of containing Philip through alliances with Flanders and
    Boulogne, and accepted Philip's right as the legitimate feudal overlord of John's
    lands in France. John's policy earned him the disrespectful title of "John Softsword"
    from some English chroniclers, who contrasted his behaviour with his more aggressive
    brother, Richard.
  question: When was the Treaty of Le Goulet negotiated?
- answer: rotation operations
  context: 'In many situations it is desirable to consider two group elements the
    same if they differ by an element of a given subgroup. For example, in D4 above,
    once a reflection is performed, the square never gets back to the r2 configuration
    by just applying the rotation operations (and no further reflections), i.e. the
    rotation operations are irrelevant to the question whether a reflection has been
    performed. Cosets are used to formalize this insight: a subgroup H defines left
    and right cosets, which can be thought of as translations of H by arbitrary group
    elements g. In symbolic terms, the left and right cosets of H containing g are'
  question: What should not be considered when asking if a reflection has been performed?
- answer: iPod photo
  context: "The iPod line can play several audio file formats including MP3, AAC/M4A,\
    \ Protected AAC, AIFF, WAV, Audible audiobook, and Apple Lossless. The iPod photo\
    \ introduced the ability to display JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and PNG image file formats.\
    \ Fifth and sixth generation iPod Classics, as well as third generation iPod Nanos,\
    \ can additionally play MPEG-4 (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC) and QuickTime video formats,\
    \ with restrictions on video dimensions, encoding techniques and data-rates. Originally,\
    \ iPod software only worked with Mac OS; iPod software for Microsoft Windows was\
    \ launched with the second generation model. Unlike most other media players,\
    \ Apple does not support Microsoft's WMA audio format\u2014but a converter for\
    \ WMA files without Digital Rights Management (DRM) is provided with the Windows\
    \ version of iTunes. MIDI files also cannot be played, but can be converted to\
    \ audio files using the \"Advanced\" menu in iTunes. Alternative open-source audio\
    \ formats, such as Ogg Vorbis and FLAC, are not supported without installing custom\
    \ firmware onto an iPod (e.g., Rockbox)."
  question: What was the first model to support JPEG and other still image formats?
- answer: London Gazette
  context: 'The London Gazette of 17 March 1691 published a patent in favour of John
    Lofting for a fire engine, but remarked upon and recommended another invention
    of his, for a beer pump:'
  question: In what newspaper did John Lofting mention his beer pump?
- answer: commercialism
  context: Some of the later writers about the show were more positive, Michael Slezak,
    again of Entertainment Weekly, thought that "for all its bloated, synthetic, product-shilling,
    money-making trappings, Idol provides a once-a-year chance for the average American
    to combat the evils of today's music business." Singer Sheryl Crow, who was later
    to act as a mentor on the show, however took the view that the show "undermines
    art in every way and promotes commercialism". Pop music critic Ann Powers nevertheless
    suggested that Idol has "reshaped the American songbook", "led us toward a new
    way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture", and connects
    "the classic Hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future."
    Others focused on the personalities in the show; Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek accused
    judge Simon Cowell's cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the
    wider world a culture of meanness, that "Simon Cowell has dragged the rest of
    us in the mud with him." Some such as singer John Mayer disparaged the contestants,
    suggesting that those who appeared on Idol are not real artists with self-respect.
  question: Sheryl Crow felt the show undermined art and promoted what?
- answer: Cyprus has officially adopted a neutral flag
  context: "The most widely used symbol is the flag of Greece, which features nine\
    \ equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white representing the nine\
    \ syllables of the Greek national motto Eleftheria i thanatos (freedom or death),\
    \ which was the motto of the Greek War of Independence. The blue square in the\
    \ upper hoist-side corner bears a white cross, which represents Greek Orthodoxy.\
    \ The Greek flag is widely used by the Greek Cypriots, although Cyprus has officially\
    \ adopted a neutral flag to ease ethnic tensions with the Turkish Cypriot minority\
    \ \u2013 see flag of Cyprus)."
  question: Have the people of Greece done anything to make the matter more palatable
    for the people of Turkey ?
- answer: '1453'
  context: The Late Middle Ages represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic
    known as the Black Death and an associated famine caused demographic catastrophe
    in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and wars of conquest
    kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In the Balkans,
    the Ottoman Empire, a Turkish state originating in Anatolia, encroached steadily
    on former Byzantine lands, culminating in the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.
  question: When did the Ottoman Empire conquer Constantinople?
- answer: General Pile
  context: London's defences were rapidly reorganised by General Pile, the Commander-in-Chief
    of Anti-Aircraft Command. The difference this made to the effectiveness of air
    defences is questionable. The British were still one-third below the establishment
    of heavy anti-aircraft artillery AAA (or ack-ack) in May 1941, with only 2,631
    weapons available. Dowding had to rely on night fighters. From 1940 to 1941, the
    most successful night-fighter was the Boulton Paul Defiant; its four squadrons
    shot down more enemy aircraft than any other type. AA defences improved by better
    use of radar and searchlights. Over several months, the 20,000 shells spent per
    raider shot down in September 1940, was reduced to 4,087 in January 1941 and to
    2,963 shells in February 1941.
  question: Who reorganised London's defences?
- answer: Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries
  context: "For centuries, Jews worldwide have spoken the local or dominant languages\
    \ of the regions they migrated to, often developing distinctive dialectal forms\
    \ or branches that became independent languages. Yiddish is the Jud\xE6o-German\
    \ language developed by Ashkenazi Jews who migrated to Central Europe. Ladino\
    \ is the Jud\xE6o-Spanish language developed by Sephardic Jews who migrated to\
    \ the Iberian peninsula. Due to many factors, including the impact of the Holocaust\
    \ on European Jewry, the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries, and widespread\
    \ emigration from other Jewish communities around the world, ancient and distinct\
    \ Jewish languages of several communities, including Jud\xE6o-Georgian, Jud\xE6\
    o-Arabic, Jud\xE6o-Berber, Krymchak, Jud\xE6o-Malayalam and many others, have\
    \ largely fallen out of use."
  question: Name one reason the ancient and distinct Jewish languages have largely
    fallen out of use?
- answer: Anglo-Irish
  context: Subjective Idealism (immaterialism or phenomenalism) describes a relationship
    between experience and the world in which objects are no more than collections
    or "bundles" of sense data in the perceiver. Proponents include Berkeley, Bishop
    of Cloyne, an Anglo-Irish philosopher who advanced a theory he called immaterialism,
    later referred to as "subjective idealism", contending that individuals can only
    know sensations and ideas of objects directly, not abstractions such as "matter",
    and that ideas also depend upon being perceived for their very existence - esse
    est percipi; "to be is to be perceived".
  question: What was Berkeley's ethnicity?
- answer: 200,000 to 400,000
  context: "Near the northern Greek borders there are also some Slavic\u2013speaking\
    \ groups, locally known as Slavomacedonian-speaking, most of whose members identify\
    \ ethnically as Greeks. Their dialects can be linguistically classified as forms\
    \ of either Macedonian Slavic or Bulgarian. It is estimated that after the population\
    \ exchanges of 1923, Macedonia had 200,000 to 400,000 Slavic speakers. The Jewish\
    \ community in Greece traditionally spoke Ladino (Judeo-Spanish), today maintained\
    \ only by a few thousand speakers. Other notable minority languages include Armenian,\
    \ Georgian, and the Greco-Turkic dialect spoken by the Urums, a community of Caucasus\
    \ Greeks from the Tsalka region of central Georgia and ethnic Greeks from southeastern\
    \ Ukraine who arrived in mainly Northern Greece as economic migrants in the 1990s."
  question: Macedonia has how many Slavic speakers?
- answer: Hadrian
  context: Officially, human sacrifice was obnoxious "to the laws of gods and men."
    The practice was a mark of the "Other", attributed to Rome's traditional enemies
    such as the Carthaginians and Gauls. Rome banned it on several occasions under
    extreme penalty. A law passed in 81 BC characterised human sacrifice as murder
    committed for magical purposes. Pliny saw the ending of human sacrifice conducted
    by the druids as a positive consequence of the conquest of Gaul and Britain. Despite
    an empire-wide ban under Hadrian, human sacrifice may have continued covertly
    in North Africa and elsewhere.
  question: What ruler banned human sacrifice empire wide?
- answer: '"time-sharing"'
  context: One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt,
    which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where
    it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior
    to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs
    are running "at the same time". then the interrupt generator might be causing
    several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since
    modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster
    than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same
    time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method
    of multitasking is sometimes termed "time-sharing" since each program is allocated
    a "slice" of time in turn.
  question: A method of multitasking that takes a "slice" of time in turn is called
    what?
- answer: 1,920 pixels wide and 1,080 pixels high
  context: "For example, 1920\xD71080p25 identifies progressive scanning format with\
    \ 25 frames per second, each frame being 1,920 pixels wide and 1,080 pixels high.\
    \ The 1080i25 or 1080i50 notation identifies interlaced scanning format with 25\
    \ frames (50 fields) per second, each frame being 1,920 pixels wide and 1,080\
    \ pixels high. The 1080i30 or 1080i60 notation identifies interlaced scanning\
    \ format with 30 frames (60 fields) per second, each frame being 1,920 pixels\
    \ wide and 1,080 pixels high. The 720p60 notation identifies progressive scanning\
    \ format with 60 frames per second, each frame being 720 pixels high; 1,280 pixels\
    \ horizontally are implied."
  question: What size is each 1920x1080p25 frame?
- answer: 95%
  context: The largest use of asphalt/bitumen is for making asphalt concrete for road
    surfaces and accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the United
    States. Asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5% asphalt/bitumen
    cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous
    nature, asphalt/bitumen cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates
    at the asphalt mixing facility. The temperature required varies depending upon
    characteristics of the asphalt/bitumen and the aggregates, but warm-mix asphalt
    technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required. There are about
    4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the U.S., and a similar number in Europe.
  question: What percentage of concrete mixes is aggregates?
- answer: small sekreton
  context: "Important fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the Great Palace\
    \ of Constantinople which was commissioned during Justinian's reign. The figures,\
    \ animals, plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain\
    \ background. The portrait of a moustached man, probably a Gothic chieftain, is\
    \ considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age. The\
    \ so-called small sekreton of the palace was built during Justin II's reign around\
    \ 565\u2013577. Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room.\
    \ The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and\
    \ they still closely follow the Classical tradition. There are remains of floral\
    \ decoration in the Church of the Acheiropoietos in Thessaloniki (5th\u20136th\
    \ centuries)."
  question: What was the small vaulted room in the Great Palace of Constantinople
    called?
- answer: equity theaters
  context: The 5th Avenue Theatre, built in 1926, stages Broadway-style musical shows
    featuring both local talent and international stars. Seattle has "around 100"
    theatrical production companies and over two dozen live theatre venues, many of
    them associated with fringe theatre; Seattle is probably second only to New York
    for number of equity theaters (28 Seattle theater companies have some sort of
    Actors' Equity contract). In addition, the 900-seat Romanesque Revival Town Hall
    on First Hill hosts numerous cultural events, especially lectures and recitals.
  question: To what type of theater is Seattle second to New York?
- answer: that when the individuals' behavior as well as their identity are analyzed,
    most people appeared to be at least somewhat bisexual
  context: "In the oft-cited and oft-criticized Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\
    \ (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), by Alfred C. Kinsey et\
    \ al., people were asked to rate themselves on a scale from completely heterosexual\
    \ to completely homosexual. Kinsey reported that when the individuals' behavior\
    \ as well as their identity are analyzed, most people appeared to be at least\
    \ somewhat bisexual \u2014 i.e., most people have some attraction to either sex,\
    \ although usually one sex is preferred. According to Kinsey, only a minority\
    \ (5\u201310%) can be considered fully heterosexual or homosexual.[citation needed]\
    \ Conversely, only an even smaller minority can be considered fully bisexual (with\
    \ an equal attraction to both sexes). Kinsey's methods have been criticized as\
    \ flawed, particularly with regard to the randomness of his sample population,\
    \ which included prison inmates, male prostitutes and those who willingly participated\
    \ in discussion of previously taboo sexual topics. Nevertheless, Paul Gebhard,\
    \ subsequent director of the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research, reexamined the\
    \ data in the Kinsey Reports and concluded that removing the prison inmates and\
    \ prostitutes barely affected the results."
  question: What did KInsey find during these studies ?
- answer: '1347'
  context: These troubles were followed in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that
    spread throughout Europe during the following three years.[AC] The death toll
    was probably about 35 million people in Europe, about one-third of the population.
    Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions.[AD] Large
    areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left
    unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available
    workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for
    food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that
    they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe.
    Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England,
    and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders.
    The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested
    by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants,
    and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return
    of the plague throughout the rest of the 14th century; it continued to strike
    Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.
  question: When did the Black Death start?
- answer: If any girl became pregnant outside of marriage, her family paid a fine
  context: The Reed Dance today is not an ancient ceremony but a development of the
    old "umchwasho" custom. In "umchwasho", all young girls were placed in a female
    age-regiment. If any girl became pregnant outside of marriage, her family paid
    a fine of one cow to the local chief. After a number of years, when the girls
    had reached a marriageable age, they would perform labour service for the Queen
    Mother, ending with dancing and feasting. The country was under the chastity rite
    of "umchwasho" until 19 August 2005.
  question: What occurs during the custom of umchwaso in Swaziland?
- answer: House of Hanover
  context: "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries\
    \ to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830. It is eponymous\
    \ for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover\u2014George I, George\
    \ II, George III, and George IV\u2014who reigned in continuous succession from\
    \ August 1714 to June 1830. The style was revived in the late 19th century in\
    \ the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century\
    \ in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture; in both it is also called Georgian\
    \ Revival architecture. In America the term \"Georgian\" is generally used to\
    \ describe all building from the period, regardless of style; in Britain it is\
    \ generally restricted to buildings that are \"architectural in intention\", and\
    \ have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period, though that covers\
    \ a wide range."
  question: What was the name of the house of the monarchs in power from 1714 and
    1830?
- answer: audio CD tracks
  context: CD-Vs are not to be confused with Video CDs (which are all-digital and
    can only be played on VCD players, DVD players, CD-i players, computers, and later-model
    LaserDisc players, such as the DVL series from Pioneer that can also play DVDs).
    CD-Vs can only be played back on LaserDisc players with CD-V capability. VSDs
    were the same as CD-Vs, but without the audio CD tracks. CD-Vs were somewhat popular
    for a brief time worldwide, but soon faded from view. VSDs were popular only in
    Japan and other parts of Asia, and were never fully introduced to the rest of
    the world.
  question: What were VSDs lacking that CD-Vs included?
- answer: "reverting Kaliningrad's name to its historic name of K\xF6nigsberg"
  context: "Although the 1945\u20131949 expulsion of Germans from the northern part\
    \ of former East Prussia was often conducted in a violent and aggressive way by\
    \ Soviet officials, the present Russian inhabitants of the Kaliningrad Oblast\
    \ have much less animosity towards Germans. German names have been revived in\
    \ commercial Russian trade and there is sometimes talk of reverting Kaliningrad's\
    \ name to its historic name of K\xF6nigsberg. The city centre of Kaliningrad was\
    \ completely rebuilt, as British bombs in 1944 and the Soviet siege in 1945 had\
    \ left it in nothing but ruins."
  question: What has since been considered in Kalinigrad?
- answer: 9th
  context: Other sections of society included the nobility, clergy, and townsmen.
    Nobles, both the titled nobility and simple knights, exploited the manors and
    the peasants, although they did not own lands outright but were granted rights
    to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the system of
    feudalism. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these lands, or fiefs, came to
    be considered hereditary, and in most areas they were no longer divisible between
    all the heirs as had been the case in the early medieval period. Instead, most
    fiefs and lands went to the eldest son.[R] The dominance of the nobility was built
    upon its control of the land, its military service as heavy cavalry, control of
    castles, and various immunities from taxes or other impositions.[S] Castles, initially
    in wood but later in stone, began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries
    in response to the disorder of the time, and provided protection from invaders
    as well as allowing lords defence from rivals. Control of castles allowed the
    nobles to defy kings or other overlords. Nobles were stratified; kings and the
    highest-ranking nobility controlled large numbers of commoners and large tracts
    of land, as well as other nobles. Beneath them, lesser nobles had authority over
    smaller areas of land and fewer people. Knights were the lowest level of nobility;
    they controlled but did not own land, and had to serve other nobles.[T]
  question: In what century were castles first built?
- answer: Wales
  context: "In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's\
    \ Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted a successful businessman\
    \ named Elihu Yale, who lived in Wales but had been born in Boston and whose father,\
    \ David, had been one of the original settlers in New Haven, to ask him for financial\
    \ help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion\
    \ of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living\
    \ in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales\
    \ of goods, which were sold for more than \xA3560, a substantial sum at the time.\
    \ Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College. Meanwhile,\
    \ a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals\
    \ that they should donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented\
    \ the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology. It\
    \ had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards\
    \ discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the\
    \ \"new divinity.\" In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study\
    \ group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism,\
    \ become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England\
    \ and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas\
    \ Clapp became president in 1745, and struggled to return the college to Calvinist\
    \ orthodoxy; but he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books\
    \ in the library."
  question: Where did Elihu Yale grow up?
- answer: the Secretary of State for War, the First Lord of the Admiralty, and the
    Secretary of State for Air
  context: "Winston Churchill, on forming his government in 1940, created the office\
    \ of Minister of Defence to exercise ministerial control over the Chiefs of Staff\
    \ Committee and to co-ordinate defence matters. The post was held by the Prime\
    \ Minister of the day until Clement Attlee's government introduced the Ministry\
    \ of Defence Act of 1946. The new ministry was headed by a Minister of Defence\
    \ who possessed a seat in the Cabinet. The three existing service Ministers\u2014\
    the Secretary of State for War, the First Lord of the Admiralty, and the Secretary\
    \ of State for Air\u2014remained in direct operational control of their respective\
    \ services, but ceased to attend Cabinet."
  question: Who stopped attending Cabinet with the passage of the Ministry of Defence
    Act of 1946?
- answer: Rufino Tamayo
  context: "Mexico City has numerous museums dedicated to art, including Mexican colonial,\
    \ modern and contemporary art, and international art. The Museo Tamayo was opened\
    \ in the mid-1980s to house the collection of international contemporary art donated\
    \ by famed Mexican (born in the state of Oaxaca) painter Rufino Tamayo. The collection\
    \ includes pieces by Picasso, Klee, Kandinsky, Warhol and many others, though\
    \ most of the collection is stored while visiting exhibits are shown. The Museo\
    \ de Arte Moderno (Museum of Modern Art) is a repository of Mexican artists from\
    \ the 20th century, including Rivera, Orozco, Siqueiros, Kahlo, Gerzso, Carrington,\
    \ Tamayo, among others, and also regularly hosts temporary exhibits of international\
    \ modern art. In southern Mexico City, the Museo Carrillo Gil (Carrillo Gil Museum)\
    \ showcases avant-garde artists, as does the University Museum/Contemporary Art\
    \ (Museo Universitario Arte Contempor\xE1neo \u2013 or MUAC), designed by famed\
    \ Mexican architect Teodoro Gonz\xE1lez de Le\xF3n, inaugurated in late 2008."
  question: Who's art collection was the reason the Museo Tamayo opened?
- answer: priest-king
  context: Sumerian cities during the Uruk period were probably theocratic and were
    most likely headed by a priest-king (ensi), assisted by a council of elders, including
    both men and women. It is quite possible that the later Sumerian pantheon was
    modeled upon this political structure. There was little evidence of organized
    warfare or professional soldiers during the Uruk period, and towns were generally
    unwalled. During this period Uruk became the most urbanized city in the world,
    surpassing for the first time 50,000 inhabitants.
  question: What is an "ensi"?
- answer: communications
  context: Companies with limited resources may choose to engage in only a few of
    these activities, while larger organizations may employ a full spectrum of communications.
    Since it is difficult to develop such a broad range of skills, communications
    professionals often specialize in one or two of these areas but usually have at
    least a working knowledge of most of them. By far, the most important qualifications
    communications professionals can possess are excellent writing ability, good 'people'
    skills, and the capacity to think critically and strategically.
  question: Good people skills is a qualification that is important to what profession?
- answer: Lilibet
  context: "The Duke and Duchess of York had two children: Elizabeth (called \"Lilibet\"\
    \ by the family), and Margaret. The Duke and Duchess and their two daughters lived\
    \ a relatively sheltered life at their London residence, 145 Piccadilly. They\
    \ were a close and loving family. One of the few stirs arose when the Canadian\
    \ Prime Minister, R. B. Bennett, considered the Duke for Governor General of Canada\
    \ in 1931\u2014a proposal that King George V rejected on the advice of the Secretary\
    \ of State for Dominion Affairs, J. H. Thomas."
  question: What was Elizabeth's nickname?
- answer: around 50%
  context: On 7 August 1998, al-Qaeda struck the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
    killing 224 people, including 12 Americans. In retaliation, U.S. President Bill
    Clinton launched Operation Infinite Reach, a bombing campaign in Sudan and Afghanistan
    against targets the U.S. asserted were associated with WIFJAJC, although others
    have questioned whether a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan was used as a chemical
    warfare plant. The plant produced much of the region's antimalarial drugs and
    around 50% of Sudan's pharmaceutical needs. The strikes failed to kill any leaders
    of WIFJAJC or the Taliban.
  question: How much of Sudan's medicines were produced by a pharmaceutical plant
    Clinton's operation bombed?
- answer: 100 million
  context: The two finalists were Kris Allen and Adam Lambert, both of whom had previously
    landed in the bottom three at the top five. Allen won the contest in the most
    controversial voting result since season two. It was claimed, later retracted,
    that 38 million of the 100 million votes cast on the night came from Allen's home
    state of Arkansas alone, and that AT&T employees unfairly influenced the votes
    by giving lessons on power-texting at viewing parties in Arkansas.
  question: How many votes were cast for the final two?
- answer: 31 BC
  context: The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history
    and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and
    the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC
    and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time,
    Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia,
    experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre,
    architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive
    public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters.
    It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or
    degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic
    period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the
    philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works
    of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere
    expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities
    such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism.
  question: When was the Battle of Actium?
- answer: snow
  context: Due to its location at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little
    solar radiation. This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly
    in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and
    almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet
    which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice
    streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental
    shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers
    from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that
    ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand
    the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels
    and the implications of global cooling.
  question: What is the usual condition of precipitation in the Antarctic?
- answer: Petrarch
  context: Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, written in the early 14th century, merged
    a medieval world view with classical ideals. Another promoter of the Italian language
    was Boccaccio with his Decameron. The application of the vernacular did not entail
    a rejection of Latin, and both Dante and Boccaccio wrote prolifically in Latin
    as well as Italian, as would Petrarch later (whose Canzoniere also promoted the
    vernacular and whose contents are considered the first modern lyric poems). Together
    the three poets established the Tuscan dialect as the norm for the modern Italian
    language.
  question: Whose work, Canzoniere, is considered to be the first example of modern
    lyric poetry?
- answer: global carrying capacity
  context: The existence of a "global carrying capacity", limiting the amount of life
    that can live at once, is debated, as is the question of whether such a limit
    would also cap the number of species. While records of life in the sea shows a
    logistic pattern of growth, life on land (insects, plants and tetrapods)shows
    an exponential rise in diversity. As one author states, "Tetrapods have not yet
    invaded 64 per cent of potentially habitable modes, and it could be that without
    human influence the ecological and taxonomic diversity of tetrapods would continue
    to increase in an exponential fashion until most or all of the available ecospace
    is filled."
  question: What limits the amount of life that can live at once on Earth?
- answer: identical
  context: One of the first recorded instances of translation in the West was the
    rendering of the Old Testament into Greek in the 3rd century BCE. The translation
    is known as the "Septuagint", a name that refers to the seventy translators (seventy-two,
    in some versions) who were commissioned to translate the Bible at Alexandria,
    Egypt. Each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell, and according
    to legend all seventy versions proved identical. The Septuagint became the source
    text for later translations into many languages, including Latin, Coptic, Armenian
    and Georgian.
  question: According to myth, what property did all seventy versions of the bible
    have?
- answer: U+2028
  context: In terms of the newline, Unicode introduced U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR and U+2029
    PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR. This was an attempt to provide a Unicode solution to encoding
    paragraphs and lines semantically, potentially replacing all of the various platform
    solutions. In doing so, Unicode does provide a way around the historical platform
    dependent solutions. Nonetheless, few if any Unicode solutions have adopted these
    Unicode line and paragraph separators as the sole canonical line ending characters.
    However, a common approach to solving this issue is through newline normalization.
    This is achieved with the Cocoa text system in Mac OS X and also with W3C XML
    and HTML recommendations. In this approach every possible newline character is
    converted internally to a common newline (which one does not really matter since
    it is an internal operation just for rendering). In other words, the text system
    can correctly treat the character as a newline, regardless of the input's actual
    encoding.
  question: What is the code for separating lines?
- answer: Lyndon B. Johnson
  context: The Democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election. Eisenhower
    had to work with the Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson (later U.S.
    president) in the Senate and Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House, both from Texas.
    Joe Martin, the Republican Speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955,
    wrote that Eisenhower "never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve
    political problems with professional skill. There were exceptions, Leonard W.
    Hall, for example, who as chairman of the Republican National Committee tried
    to open the administration's eyes to the political facts of life, with occasional
    success. However, these exceptions were not enough to right the balance."
  question: Who was made Senate Majority Leader after the 1954 election?
- answer: hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide
  context: "The gut is generally an almost straight tube supported by the mesenteries\
    \ (vertical partitions within segments), and ends with the anus on the underside\
    \ of the pygidium. However, in members of the tube-dwelling family Siboglinidae\
    \ the gut is blocked by a swollen lining that houses symbiotic bacteria, which\
    \ can make up 15% of the worms' total weight. The bacteria convert inorganic matter\
    \ \u2013 such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from hydrothermal vents,\
    \ or methane from seeps \u2013 to organic matter that feeds themselves and their\
    \ hosts, while the worms extend their palps into the gas flows to absorb the gases\
    \ needed by the bacteria."
  question: What gases come from hydrothermal vents?
- answer: 1645 and 1648
  context: In England, Presbyterianism was established in secret in 1592. Thomas Cartwright
    is thought to be the first Presbyterian in England. Cartwright's controversial
    lectures at Cambridge University condemning the episcopal hierarchy of the Elizabethan
    Church led to his deprivation of his post by Archbishop John Whitgift and his
    emigration abroad. Between 1645 and 1648, a series of ordinances of the Long Parliament
    established Presbyterianism as the polity of the Church of England. Presbyterian
    government was established in London and Lancashire and in a few other places
    in England, although Presbyterian hostility to the execution of Charles I and
    the establishment of the republican Commonwealth of England meant that Parliament
    never enforced the Presbyterian system in England. The re-establishment of the
    monarchy in 1660 brought the return of Episcopal church government in England
    (and in Scotland for a short time); but the Presbyterian church in England continued
    in Non-Conformity, outside of the established church. In 1719 a major split, the
    Salter's Hall controversy, occurred; with the majority siding with nontrinitarian
    views. Thomas Bradbury published several sermons bearing on the controversy, and
    in 1719, "An answer to the reproaches cast on the dissenting ministers who subscribed
    their belief of the Eternal Trinity.". By the 18th century many English Presbyterian
    congregations had become Unitarian in doctrine.
  question: Between what years were the ordinances enacted Presbyterianism as the
    polity of the Church of England?
- answer: one person
  context: Since the 1980s, as the complexity of buildings began to increase (in terms
    of structural systems, services, energy and technologies), the field of architecture
    became multi-disciplinary with specializations for each project type, technological
    expertise or project delivery methods. In addition, there has been an increased
    separation of the 'design' architect [Notes 1] from the 'project' architect who
    ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of
    liability.[Notes 2] The preparatory processes for the design of any large building
    have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such
    matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local
    laws. A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be
    the work of many. Modernism and Postmodernism have been criticised by some members
    of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a
    personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has
    to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments,
    with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental,
    and social sciences.
  question: Who can no longer design a large structure?
- answer: bacilli
  context: "Most bacterial species are either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus,\
    \ from Greek k\xF3kkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus,\
    \ from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation is associated with swimming. Some bacteria,\
    \ called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others\
    \ can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes.\
    \ A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently,\
    \ some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching\
    \ filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface area to\
    \ volume ratio of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor\
    \ environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell\
    \ wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability\
    \ of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and\
    \ escape predators."
  question: What type of bacteria usually takes rod-shaped form?
- answer: ten times
  context: The most obvious difference between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates
    is in terms of size. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as
    that of a bird of the same body size, and ten times as large as that of a reptile
    of the same body size.
  question: A mammal's brain is how many times larger than a reptiles relative to
    body size?
- answer: Sudan
  context: Somalis have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali folklore.
    Most Somali songs are pentatonic. That is, they only use five pitches per octave
    in contrast to a heptatonic (seven note) scale, such as the major scale. At first
    listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as
    Ethiopia, Sudan or Arabia, but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique
    tunes and styles. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between
    lyricists (midho), songwriters (lahan) and singers ('odka or "voice").
  question: Along with Arabia and Ethiopia, what land has songs that sound similar
    to those of Somalia?
- answer: '215'
  context: Southeastern Pennsylvania was assigned the 215 area code in 1947 when the
    North American Numbering Plan of the "Bell System" went into effect. The geographic
    area covered by the code was split nearly in half in 1994 when area code 610 was
    created, with the city and its northern suburbs retaining 215. Overlay area code
    267 was added to the 215 service area in 1997, and 484 was added to the 610 area
    in 1999. A plan in 2001 to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas
    (area code 445 to 215, area code 835 to 610) was delayed and later rescinded.
  question: What area code is used in Philadelphia in 1947?
- answer: hatch from eggs
  context: "The life cycles of insects vary but most hatch from eggs. Insect growth\
    \ is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series\
    \ of molts. The immature stages can differ from the adults in structure, habit\
    \ and habitat, and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo\
    \ 4-stage metamorphosis (see holometabolism). Insects that undergo 3-stage metamorphosis\
    \ lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of nymphal stages. The\
    \ higher level relationship of the Hexapoda is unclear. Fossilized insects of\
    \ enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era, including giant dragonflies\
    \ with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm (22\u201328 in). The most diverse insect groups\
    \ appear to have coevolved with flowering plants."
  question: How does the lifecycle of most insects typically begin?
- answer: Boys and girls
  context: "Child labour has been a consistent struggle for children in Brazil ever\
    \ since the country was colonized on April 22, 1550 by Pedro \xC1lvares Cabral.\
    \ Work that many children took part in was not always visible, legal, or paid.\
    \ Free or slave labour was a common occurrence for many youths and was a part\
    \ of their everyday lives as they grew into adulthood. Yet due to there being\
    \ no clear definition of how to classify what a child or youth is, there has been\
    \ little historical documentation of child labour during the colonial period.\
    \ Due to this lack of documentation, it is hard to determine just how many children\
    \ were used for what kinds of work before the nineteenth century. The first documentation\
    \ of child labour in Brazil occurred during the time of indigenous societies and\
    \ slave labour where it was found that children were forcibly working on tasks\
    \ that exceeded their emotional and physical limits. Armando Dias, for example,\
    \ died in November 1913 whilst still very young, a victim of an electric shock\
    \ when entering the textile industry where he worked. Boys and girls were victims\
    \ of industrial accidents on a daily basis."
  question: Who were the victims of industrial accidents?
- answer: 57.4% dark brown
  context: Another study from 2012 included 150 dental school students from University
    of Athens, the result showed that light hair colour (blonde/light ash brown) was
    predominant in 10.7% of the students. 36% had medium hair colour (Light brown/Medium
    darkest brown). 32% had darkest brown and 21% black (15.3 off black, 6% midnight
    black). In conclusion the hair colour of young Greeks are mostly brown, ranging
    from light to dark brown. with significant minorities having black and blonde
    hair. The same study also showed that the eye colour of the students was 14.6%
    blue/green, 28% medium (light brown) and 57.4% dark brown.
  question: What eye color is believed to be the norm among Greeks ?
- answer: "D\xE9j\xE0 Vu"
  context: "Beyonc\xE9's second solo album B'Day was released on September 5, 2006,\
    \ in the US, to coincide with her twenty-fifth birthday. It sold 541,000 copies\
    \ in its first week and debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming Beyonc\xE9's\
    \ second consecutive number-one album in the United States. The album's lead single\
    \ \"D\xE9j\xE0 Vu\", featuring Jay Z, reached the top five on the Billboard Hot\
    \ 100 chart. The second international single \"Irreplaceable\" was a commercial\
    \ success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand\
    \ and the United States. B'Day also produced three other singles; \"Ring the Alarm\"\
    , \"Get Me Bodied\", and \"Green Light\" (released in the United Kingdom only)."
  question: The lead single from the album was which song?
- answer: more than 13 million dollars
  context: 'The undergraduates have a number of traditions: Painting The Rock (originally
    a fountain donated by the Class of 1902) is a way to advertise, for example, campus
    organizations, events in Greek life, student groups, and university-wide events.
    Dance Marathon, a 30-hour philanthropic event, has raised more than 13 million
    dollars in its history for various children''s charities. Primal Scream is held
    at 9 p.m. on the Sunday before finals week every quarter; students lean out of
    windows or gather in courtyards and scream. Armadillo Day, or, more popularly,
    Dillo Day, a day of music and food, is held on Northwestern''s Lakefill every
    Spring on the weekend after Memorial Day. And in one of the University''s newer
    traditions, every year during freshman orientation, known as Wildcat Welcome,
    freshmen and transfer students pass through Weber Arch to the loud huzzahs of
    upperclassmen and the music of the University Marching Band.'
  question: How much money has the traditional Northwestern Dance Marathon raised
    for children's charities?
- answer: mutations
  context: "DNA replication is for the most part extremely accurate, however errors\
    \ (mutations) do occur.:7.6 The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as\
    \ 10\u22128 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can\
    \ be as high as 10\u22123. This means that each generation, each human genome\
    \ accumulates 1\u20132 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication\
    \ and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single\
    \ base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted\
    \ or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change\
    \ a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon).\
    \ Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal\
    \ abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion\
    \ of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, the DNA repair mechanisms that\
    \ normally revert mutations can introduce errors when repairing the physical damage\
    \ to the molecule is more important than restoring an exact copy, for example\
    \ when repairing double-strand breaks.:5.4"
  question: What is it called when errors occur in DNA replication?
- answer: geographically and culturally
  context: "Indigenous peoples in what is now the contiguous United States, including\
    \ their descendants, are commonly called \"American Indians\", or simply \"Indians\"\
    \ domestically, or \"Native Americans\" by the USCB. In Alaska, indigenous peoples\
    \ belong to 11 cultures with 11 languages. These include the St. Lawrence Island\
    \ Yupik, I\xF1upiat, Athabaskan, Yup'ik, Cup'ik, Unangax, Alutiiq, Eyak, Haida,\
    \ Tsimshian, and Tlingit, who are collectively called Alaska Natives. Indigenous\
    \ Polynesian peoples, which include Marshallese, Samoan, Tahitian, and Tongan,\
    \ are politically considered Pacific Islands American but are geographically and\
    \ culturally distinct from indigenous peoples of the Americas."
  question: How are Pacific Islands Americans distinct from the indigenous peoples
    of the Americas?
- answer: Barack Obama
  context: 'After the 1948 election, the state turned firmly Republican. Although
    registered Republicans were a minority in the state until 2015, starting in 1952,
    Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates in all but one
    election (1964). This is not to say that every election has been a landslide for
    Republicans: Jimmy Carter lost the state by less than 1.5% in 1976, while Michael
    Dukakis and Bill Clinton both won 40% or more of the state''s popular vote in
    1988 and 1996 respectively. Al Gore in 2000, though, was the last Democrat to
    even win any counties in the state. Oklahoma was the only state where Barack Obama
    failed to carry any of its counties in both 2008 and 2012.'
  question: Oklahoma was the only state where which presidential candidate won no
    counties twice?
- answer: Minority Leader
  context: Traditionally, the Speaker is reckoned as the leader of the majority party
    in the House, with the Majority Leader as second-in-command. For instance, when
    the Republicans gained the majority in the House after the 2010 elections, Eric
    Cantor succeeded Boehner as Majority Leader. Despite this, Cantor and his successor,
    Kevin McCarthy, have been reckoned as the second-ranking Republicans in the House,
    since Boehner is still reckoned as the leader of the House Republicans. However,
    there have been some exceptions. The most recent exception to this rule came when
    Majority Leader Tom DeLay generally overshadowed Speaker Dennis Hastert from 2003
    to 2006. In contrast, the Minority Leader is the undisputed leader of the minority
    party.
  question: Who is the leader of the minority party in the House?
- answer: 5th century
  context: Kathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries, including the
    National Museum of Nepal and the Natural History Museum of Nepal. Nepal's art
    and architecture is an amalgamation of two ancient religions, Hinduism and Buddhhism.
    These are amply reflected in the many temples, shrines, stupas, monasteries, and
    palaces in the seven well-defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley are part
    of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This amalgamation is also reflected in the planning
    and exhibitions in museums and art galleries throughout Kathmandu and its sister
    cities of Patan and Bhaktapur. The museums display unique artifacts and paintings
    from the 5th century CE to the present day, including archeological exportation.
  question: From what time period are the oldest artifacts in Kathmandu museums?
- answer: 31 BCE, 363, 749, and 1033 CE
  context: The most catastrophic earthquakes we know of occurred in 31 BCE, 363, 749,
    and 1033 CE, that is every ca. 400 years on average. Destructive earthquakes leading
    to serious loss of life strike about every 80 years. While stringent construction
    regulations are currently in place and recently built structures are earthquake-safe,
    as of 2007[update] the majority of the buildings in Israel were older than these
    regulations and many public buildings as well as 50,000 residential buildings
    did not meet the new standards and were "expected to collapse" if exposed to a
    strong quake. Given the fragile political situation of the Middle East region
    and the presence there of major holy sites, a quake reaching magnitude 7 on the
    Richter scale could have dire consequences for world peace.
  question: When did the most catastrophic earthquakes occur?
- answer: Lin'an
  context: "The Song dynasty re\xEBstablished unity around 960. Under the Song, the\
    \ prosperity of South China began to overtake that of North China. After the north\
    \ was lost to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1127 following the Jingkang Incident,\
    \ Hangzhou became the capital of the Southern Song under the name Lin'an. Renowned\
    \ for its prosperity and beauty, it may have been the largest city in the world\
    \ at the time. From then on, north Zhejiang and neighboring south Jiangsu have\
    \ been synonymous with luxury and opulence in Chinese culture. The Mongol conquest\
    \ and the establishment of the Yuan dynasty in 1279 ended Hangzhou's political\
    \ clout, but its economy continued to prosper. Marco Polo visited the city, which\
    \ he called \"Kinsay\" (after the Chinese Jingshi, meaning \"Capital City\") claiming\
    \ it was \"the finest and noblest city in the world\"."
  question: What was Hangzhou known as while the capitol of the Southern Song?
- answer: The standard and mini connectors
  context: Counter-intuitively, the "micro" size is the most durable from the point
    of designed insertion lifetime. The standard and mini connectors were designed
    for less than daily connections, with a design lifetime of 1,500 insertion-removal
    cycles. (Improved mini-B connectors have reached 5,000-cycle lifetimes.) Micro
    connectors were designed with frequent charging of portable devices in mind; not
    only is design lifetime of the connector improved to 10,000 cycles, but it was
    also redesigned to place the flexible contacts, which wear out sooner, on the
    easily replaced cable, while the more durable rigid contacts are located in the
    micro-USB receptacles. Likewise, the springy part of the retention mechanism (parts
    that provide required gripping force) were also moved into plugs on the cable
    side.
  question: What was designed for less daily connections?
- answer: enforcing privilege separation
  context: Within computer systems, two of many security models capable of enforcing
    privilege separation are access control lists (ACLs) and capability-based security.
    Using ACLs to confine programs has been proven to be insecure in many situations,
    such as if the host computer can be tricked into indirectly allowing restricted
    file access, an issue known as the confused deputy problem. It has also been shown
    that the promise of ACLs of giving access to an object to only one person can
    never be guaranteed in practice. Both of these problems are resolved by capabilities.
    This does not mean practical flaws exist in all ACL-based systems, but only that
    the designers of certain utilities must take responsibility to ensure that they
    do not introduce flaws.[citation needed]
  question: ACLs and capability based security are two security models capable of
    what?
- answer: Supreme Court
  context: Prior to the 20th century drugs were generally produced by small scale
    manufacturers with little regulatory control over manufacturing or claims of safety
    and efficacy. To the extent that such laws did exist, enforcement was lax. In
    the United States, increased regulation of vaccines and other biological drugs
    was spurred by tetanus outbreaks and deaths caused by the distribution of contaminated
    smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 required
    that federal government grant premarket approval for every biological drug and
    for the process and facility producing such drugs. This was followed in 1906 by
    the Pure Food and Drugs Act, which forbade the interstate distribution of adulterated
    or misbranded foods and drugs. A drug was considered misbranded if it contained
    alcohol, morphine, opium, cocaine, or any of several other potentially dangerous
    or addictive drugs, and if its label failed to indicate the quantity or proportion
    of such drugs. The government's attempts to use the law to prosecute manufacturers
    for making unsupported claims of efficacy were undercut by a Supreme Court ruling
    restricting the federal government's enforcement powers to cases of incorrect
    specification of the drug's ingredients.
  question: Who restricted the federal government's enforcement powers?
- answer: "\u03B3\u03C5\u03BC\u03BD\u03CC\u03C2 (gymnos) meaning \"naked\""
  context: "The word gymnastics derives from the common Greek adjective \u03B3\u03C5\
    \u03BC\u03BD\u03CC\u03C2 (gymnos) meaning \"naked\", by way of the related verb\
    \ \u03B3\u03C5\u03BC\u03BD\u03AC\u03B6\u03C9 (gymnazo), whose meaning is to train\
    \ naked\", \"train in gymnastic exercise\", generally \"to train, to exercise\"\
    . The verb had this meaning, because athletes in ancient times exercised and competed\
    \ without clothing. It came into use in the 1570s, from Latin gymnasticus, from\
    \ Greek gymnastikos \"fond of or skilled in bodily exercise,\" from gymnazein\
    \ \"to exercise or train\" (see gymnasium)."
  question: What Greek word did gymnastics derive from?
- answer: JPMorgan Chase Tower
  context: "In the 1960s, Downtown Houston consisted of a collection of mid-rise office\
    \ structures. Downtown was on the threshold of an energy industry\u2013led boom\
    \ in 1970. A succession of skyscrapers were built throughout the 1970s\u2014many\
    \ by real estate developer Gerald D. Hines\u2014culminating with Houston's tallest\
    \ skyscraper, the 75-floor, 1,002-foot (305 m)-tall JPMorgan Chase Tower (formerly\
    \ the Texas Commerce Tower), completed in 1982. It is the tallest structure in\
    \ Texas, 15th tallest building in the United States, and the 85th tallest skyscraper\
    \ in the world, based on highest architectural feature. In 1983, the 71-floor,\
    \ 992-foot (302 m)-tall Wells Fargo Plaza (formerly Allied Bank Plaza) was completed,\
    \ becoming the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas. Based on highest\
    \ architectural feature, it is the 17th tallest in the United States and the 95th\
    \ tallest in the world. In 2007, downtown Houston had over 43 million square feet\
    \ (4,000,000 m\xB2) of office space."
  question: What is the tallest building in Texas?
- answer: '1936'
  context: South Tucson is actually the name of an independent, incorporated town
    of 1 sq mi (2.6 km2), completely surrounded by the city of Tucson, sitting just
    south of downtown. South Tucson has a colorful, dynamic history. It was first
    incorporated in 1936, and later reincorporated in 1940. The population consists
    of about 83% Mexican-American and 10% Native American residents. South Tucson
    is widely known for its many Mexican restaurants and the architectural styles
    which include bright outdoor murals, many of which have been painted over due
    to city policy.
  question: When was South Tucson first incorporated?
- answer: '52'
  context: On 16 March 2012, 52 Greenpeace activists from five different countries
    boarded Fennica and Nordica, multipurpose icebreakers chartered to support Shell's
    drilling rigs near Alaska. Around the same time period, a reporter for Fortune
    magazine spoke with Edward Itta, an Inupiat Eskimo leader and the former mayor
    of the North Slope Borough, who expressed that he was conflicted about Shell's
    plans in the Arctic, as he was very concerned that an oil spill could destroy
    the Inupiat Eskimo's hunting-and-fishing culture, but his borough also received
    major tax revenue from oil and gas production; additionally, further revenue from
    energy activity was considered crucial to the future of the living standard in
    Itta's community.
  question: How many Greenpeace activists boarded Fennica and Nordica in March 2012?
- answer: lethal injection
  context: The moratorium ended on January 17, 1977 with the shooting of Gary Gilmore
    by firing squad in Utah. The first use of the electric chair after the moratorium
    was the electrocution of John Spenkelink in Florida on May 25, 1979. The first
    use of the gas chamber after the moratorium was the gassing of Jesse Bishop in
    Nevada on October 22, 1979. The first use of the gallows after the moratorium
    was the hanging of Westley Allan Dodd in Washington on January 5, 1993. The first
    use of lethal injection was on December 7, 1982, when Charles Brooks, Jr., was
    executed in Texas.
  question: How was Charles Brooks, Jr. executed?
- answer: Columbia Recording Corporation
  context: ARC was acquired in 1938 by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS, which,
    in turn, had been formed by the Columbia Phonograph Company, but then sold off).
    ARC was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation. The Columbia Phonograph Company
    had international subsidiaries and affiliates such as the Columbia Graphophone
    Company in the United Kingdom, but they were sold off prior to CBS acquiring American
    Columbia. RCA Victor Records executive Ted Wallerstein convinced CBS head William
    S. Paley to buy ARC and Paley made Wallerstein head of the newly acquired record
    company. The renamed company made Columbia its flagship label with Okeh its subsidiary
    label while deemphasizing ARC's other labels. This allowed ARC's leased labels
    Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records to revert to former owner Warner Bros.
    which sold the labels to Decca Records. Columbia kept the Brunswick catalogue
    recorded from December 1931 onward which was reissued on the Columbia label as
    well as the Vocalion label material from the same time period which was reissued
    on the Okeh label. Wallerstein, who was promoted at the end of 1947 from president
    to chairman of the record company, restored Columbia's status as a leading record
    company and spearheaded the successful introduction of the long playing (LP) record
    before he retired as Columbia's chairman in 1951. James Conkling then became head
    of Columbia Records. Also in 1951, Columbia severed its ties with the EMI-owned
    record label of the same name and began a UK distribution deal with Philips Records,
    whereas Okeh Records continued to be distributed by EMI on the Columbia label.
  question: What did CBS call ARC after buying it?
- answer: fishing
  context: "In comparison to the other regions of Spain, the major economic benefit\
    \ of Galicia is its fishing Industry. Galicia is a land of economic contrast.\
    \ While the western coast, with its major population centers and its fishing and\
    \ manufacturing industries, is prosperous and increasing in population, the rural\
    \ hinterland \u2014 the provinces of Ourense and Lugo \u2014 is economically dependent\
    \ on traditional agriculture, based on small landholdings called minifundios.\
    \ However, the rise of tourism, sustainable forestry and organic and traditional\
    \ agriculture are bringing other possibilities to the Galician economy without\
    \ compromising the preservation of the natural resources and the local culture."
  question: Which industry is Galicia's main money maker?
- answer: Churchill
  context: After the German occupation of France in 1940, Britain and the empire stood
    alone against Germany, until the entry of the Soviet Union to the war in 1941.
    British Prime Minister Winston Churchill successfully lobbied President Franklin
    D. Roosevelt for military aid from the United States, but Roosevelt was not yet
    ready to ask Congress to commit the country to war. In August 1941, Churchill
    and Roosevelt met and signed the Atlantic Charter, which included the statement
    that "the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they
    live" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous as to whether it referred
    to European countries invaded by Germany, or the peoples colonised by European
    nations, and would later be interpreted differently by the British, Americans,
    and nationalist movements.
  question: Which British Prime Minister signed the Atlantic Charter?
- answer: US
  context: Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending
    on the country, when children enter primary education. These are also known as
    nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the US, where kindergarten is a
    term used for primary education.[citation needed] Kindergarten "provide[s] a child-centered,
    preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding
    the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on
    each of them."
  question: In what country is Kindergarten a term used for primary education?
- answer: eleven
  context: "Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known\
    \ as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a spherical ball of 68.5\u2013\
    69.5 cm (27.0\u201327.4 in) circumference, known as the football (or soccer ball).\
    \ Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's\
    \ goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team\
    \ that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams\
    \ have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led\
    \ by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws\
    \ of the Game: to be involved in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks."
  question: How many players are on each team?
- answer: felt
  context: Pressing the sheet removes the water by force; once the water is forced
    from the sheet, a special kind of felt, which is not to be confused with the traditional
    one, is used to collect the water; whereas when making paper by hand, a blotter
    sheet is used instead.
  question: Besides a blotter sheet, what can be used to collect water?
- answer: Australia
  context: The major Allied participants were the United States, the Republic of China,
    the United Kingdom (including the armed forces of British India, the Fiji Islands,
    Samoa, etc.), Australia, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, the Netherlands
    (as the possessor of the Dutch East Indies and the western part of New Guinea),
    New Zealand, and Canada, all of whom were members of the Pacific War Council.
    Mexico, Free France and many other countries also took part, especially forces
    from other British colonies.
  question: What other major continent participated as an ally of the U.S.?
- answer: infections.
  context: A Colorado study found bites in children were less severe than bites in
    adults. The incidence of dog bites in the US is 12.9 per 10,000 inhabitants, but
    for boys aged 5 to 9, the incidence rate is 60.7 per 10,000. Moreover, children
    have a much higher chance to be bitten in the face or neck. Sharp claws with powerful
    muscles behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead to serious infections.
  question: A dog scratch can lead to what medical condition?
- answer: meat
  context: The exta were the entrails of a sacrificed animal, comprising in Cicero's
    enumeration the gall bladder (fel), liver (iecur), heart (cor), and lungs (pulmones).
    The exta were exposed for litatio (divine approval) as part of Roman liturgy,
    but were "read" in the context of the disciplina Etrusca. As a product of Roman
    sacrifice, the exta and blood are reserved for the gods, while the meat (viscera)
    is shared among human beings in a communal meal. The exta of bovine victims were
    usually stewed in a pot (olla or aula), while those of sheep or pigs were grilled
    on skewers. When the deity's portion was cooked, it was sprinkled with mola salsa
    (ritually prepared salted flour) and wine, then placed in the fire on the altar
    for the offering; the technical verb for this action was porricere.
  question: What part of the sacrifice was shared among humans?
- answer: Herb Wesson
  context: Schwarzenegger's official height of 6'2" (1.88 m) has been brought into
    question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he was
    measured to be 6'1.5" (1.87 m), a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders.
    However, in 1988 both the Daily Mail and Time Out magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger
    appeared noticeably shorter. Prior to running for Governor, Schwarzenegger's height
    was once again questioned in an article by the Chicago Reader. As Governor, Schwarzenegger
    engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights.
    At one point, Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, "settle
    this once and for all and find out how tall he is" by using a tailor's tape measure
    on the Governor. Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the
    words "Need a lift?" on the five-foot-five inch (165 cm) Wesson's chair before
    a negotiating session in his office. Bob Mulholland also claimed Schwarzenegger
    was 5'10" (1.78 m) and that he wore risers in his boots. In 1999, Men's Health
    magazine stated his height was 5'10".
  question: What Assemblyman playfully tried to measure Schwarzenegger's height?
- answer: 25 January 1971
  context: After independence, the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into
    being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states
    (including feudal princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya,
    known in full as the Simla Hills States and four Punjab southern hill states by
    issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 and
    4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign
    Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in
    the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New
    State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation
    of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly
    was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a union territory on 1 November 1956.
    Following area of Punjab State namely Simla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti
    Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles,
    some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil
    of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Kanungo circle of Pathankot
    tehsil of Gurdaspur District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November
    1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18
    December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and
    the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the
    18th state of the Indian Union.
  question: When did Himachal emerge as the 18th state of the Indian Union?
- answer: All-Arms Air Defence
  context: 'NATO defines anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) as "measures taken to defend
    a maritime force against attacks by airborne weapons launched from aircraft, ships,
    submarines and land-based sites." In some armies the term All-Arms Air Defence
    (AAAD) is used for air defence by non-specialist troops. Other terms from the
    late 20th century include GBAD (Ground Based AD) with related terms SHORAD (Short
    Range AD) and MANPADS ("Man Portable AD Systems": typically shoulder-launched
    missiles). Anti-aircraft missiles are variously called surface-to-air missile,
    abbreviated and pronounced "SAM" and Surface to Air Guided Weapon (SAGW).'
  question: What does AAAD stand for?
- answer: Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann
  context: In 1938 Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission with
    radiochemical methods, and in 1939 Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch wrote the
    first theoretical interpretation of the fission process, which was later improved
    by Niels Bohr and John A. Wheeler. Further developments took place during World
    War II, which led to the practical application of radar and the development and
    use of the atomic bomb. Though the process had begun with the invention of the
    cyclotron by Ernest O. Lawrence in the 1930s, physics in the postwar period entered
    into a phase of what historians have called "Big Science", requiring massive machines,
    budgets, and laboratories in order to test their theories and move into new frontiers.
    The primary patron of physics became state governments, who recognized that the
    support of "basic" research could often lead to technologies useful to both military
    and industrial applications. Currently, general relativity and quantum mechanics
    are inconsistent with each other, and efforts are underway to unify the two.
  question: Who discovered nuclear fission?
- answer: Epic poetry
  context: "Epic poetry, notably the \"acritic songs\", flourished during Middle Ages.\
    \ Two chronicles, one written by Leontios Machairas and the other by Georgios\
    \ Voustronios, cover the entire Middle Ages until the end of Frankish rule (4th\
    \ century\u20131489). Po\xE8mes d'amour written in medieval Greek Cypriot date\
    \ back from the 16th century. Some of them are actual translations of poems written\
    \ by Petrarch, Bembo, Ariosto and G. Sannazzaro. Many Cypriot scholars fled Cyprus\
    \ at troubled times such as Ioannis Kigalas (c. 1622\u20131687) who migrated from\
    \ Cyprus to Italy in the 17th century, several of his works have survived in books\
    \ of other scholars."
  question: What type of artistic form flourished at the time of the Middle Ages?
- answer: the seriousness of a breach
  context: A treaty breach does not automatically suspend or terminate treaty relations,
    however. It depends on how the other parties regard the breach and how they resolve
    to respond to it. Sometimes treaties will provide for the seriousness of a breach
    to be determined by a tribunal or other independent arbiter. An advantage of such
    an arbiter is that it prevents a party from prematurely and perhaps wrongfully
    suspending or terminating its own obligations due to another's alleged material
    breach.
  question: What might a tribunal or an arbiter be asked to determine regarding a
    breach of a treaty?
- answer: Catalan medium education
  context: In Andorra, Catalan has always been the sole official language. Since the
    promulgation of the 1993 constitution, several Andorranization policies have been
    enforced, like Catalan medium education.
  question: What is an Andorran school policy?
- answer: pledged to give the foundation approximately 10 million Berkshire Hathaway
    Class B shares
  context: 'On June 25, 2006, Warren Buffett (then the world''s richest person, estimated
    worth of US$62 billion as of April 16, 2008) pledged to give the foundation approximately
    10 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares spread over multiple years through
    annual contributions, with the first year''s donation of 500,000 shares being
    worth approximately US$1.5 billion. Buffett set conditions so that these contributions
    do not simply increase the foundation''s endowment, but effectively work as a
    matching contribution, doubling the Foundation''s annual giving: "Buffett''s gift
    came with three conditions for the Gates foundation: Bill or Melinda Gates must
    be alive and active in its administration; it must continue to qualify as a charity;
    and each year it must give away an amount equal to the previous year''s Berkshire
    gift, plus an additional amount equal to 5 percent of net assets. Buffett gave
    the foundation two years to abide by the third requirement." The Gates Foundation
    received 5% (500,000) of the shares in July 2006 and will receive 5% of the remaining
    earmarked shares in the July of each following year (475,000 in 2007, 451,250
    in 2008). In July 2013, Buffet announced another donation of his company''s Class
    B, this time in the amount worth $2 billion, is going to the Bill and Melinda
    Gates Foundation.'
  question: How many shares of berkshire hathway was pledged as a donation
- answer: Mauricio Macri
  context: "Argentina: The torch relay leg in Buenos Aires, Argentina, held on April\
    \ 11, began with an artistic show at the Lola Mora amphitheatre in Costanera Sur.\
    \ In the end of the show the mayor of Buenos Aires Mauricio Macri gave the torch\
    \ to the first torchbearer, Carlos Esp\xEDnola. The leg finished at the Buenos\
    \ Aires Riding Club in the Palermo district, the last torchbearer being Gabriela\
    \ Sabatini. The 13.8 km route included landmarks like the obelisk and Plaza de\
    \ Mayo. The day was marked by several pro-Tibet protests, which included a giant\
    \ banner reading \"Free Tibet\", and an alternative \"human rights torch\" that\
    \ was lit by protesters and paraded along the route the flame was to take. Most\
    \ of these protests were peaceful in nature, and the torch was not impeded. Chinese\
    \ immigrants also turned out in support of the Games, but only minor scuffles\
    \ were reported between both groups. Runners surrounded by rows of security carried\
    \ the Olympic flame past thousands of jubilant Argentines in the most trouble-free\
    \ torch relay in nearly a week. People showered the parade route with confetti\
    \ as banks, government offices and businesses took an impromptu half-day holiday\

  question: Who was the mayor of Buenos Aires?
- answer: S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A
  context: Barbershop music is one of several uniquely American art forms. The earliest
    reports of this style of a cappella music involved African Americans. The earliest
    documented quartets all began in barbershops. In 1938, the first formal men's
    barbershop organization was formed, known as the Society for the Preservation
    and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America (S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A),
    and in 2004 rebranded itself and officially changed its public name to the Barbershop
    Harmony Society (BHS). Today the BHS has over 22,000 members in approximately
    800 chapters across the United States, and the barbershop style has spread around
    the world with organizations in many other countries. The Barbershop Harmony Society
    provides a highly organized competition structure for a cappella quartets and
    choruses singing in the barbershop style.
  question: What were the initials of the BHS before it changes its name in 2004?
- answer: Al-Andalus
  context: Many scholars (including Makdisi) have argued that early medieval universities
    were influenced by the religious madrasahs in Al-Andalus, the Emirate of Sicily,
    and the Middle East (during the Crusades). Other scholars see this argument as
    overstated. Lowe and Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences
    of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe to
    call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education, turning away
    from a concern with local institutional structures to a broader consideration
    within a global context.
  question: Madrasas in which specific location are said to have guided the formation
    of medieval universities?
- answer: length of the year
  context: Lilius's proposals had two components. Firstly, he proposed a correction
    to the length of the year. The mean tropical year is 365.24219 days long. As the
    average length of a Julian year is 365.25 days, the Julian year is almost 11 minutes
    longer than the mean tropical year. The discrepancy results in a drift of about
    three days every 400 years. Lilius's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425
    days (see Accuracy). At the time of Gregory's reform there had already been a
    drift of 10 days since the Council of Nicaea, resulting in the vernal equinox
    falling on 10 or 11 March instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of 21 March,
    and if unreformed it would drift further. Lilius proposed that the 10-day drift
    should be corrected by deleting the Julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences
    over a period of forty years, thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox
    to 21 March.
  question: What did Lilius first propose to correct in the calendar?
- answer: Family and Consumer Science
  context: 'Nutrition is taught in schools in many countries. In England and Wales,
    the Personal and Social Education and Food Technology curricula include nutrition,
    stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition
    labels on packaging. In many schools, a Nutrition class will fall within the Family
    and Consumer Science or Health departments. In some American schools, students
    are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes. Nutrition
    is offered at many schools, and, if it is not a class of its own, nutrition is
    included in other FCS or Health classes such as: Life Skills, Independent Living,
    Single Survival, Freshmen Connection, Health etc. In many Nutrition classes, students
    learn about the food groups, the food pyramid, Daily Recommended Allowances, calories,
    vitamins, minerals, malnutrition, physical activity, healthful food choices, portion
    sizes, and how to live a healthy life.'
  question: What does FCS stand for?
- answer: 25 October
  context: On the afternoon of Gaddafi's death, NTC Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril
    publicly revealed the news. Gaddafi's corpse was placed in the freezer of a local
    market alongside the corpses of Yunis Jabr and Mutassim; the bodies were publicly
    displayed for four days, with Libyans from all over the country coming to view
    them. In response to international calls, on 24 October Jibril announced that
    a commission would investigate Gaddafi's death. On 25 October, the NTC announced
    that Gaddafi had been buried at an unidentified location in the desert; Al Aan
    TV showed amateur video footage of the funeral. Seeking vengeance for the killing,
    Gaddafist sympathisers fatally wounded one of those who had captured Gaddafi,
    Omran Shaaban, near Bani Walid in September 2012.
  question: On what date did the NTC announce Gaddafi's burial?
- answer: Baptist theologian
  context: 'The phrase "[A] hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the
    church and the wilderness of the world" was first used by Baptist theologian Roger
    Williams, the founder of the colony of Rhode Island, in his 1644 book The Bloody
    Tenent of Persecution. The phrase was later used by Thomas Jefferson as a description
    of the First Amendment and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal
    government, in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists (a religious minority concerned
    about the dominant position of the Congregationalist church in Connecticut):'
  question: Who was Roger Williams?
- answer: ergodic theorem
  context: "Von Neumann's mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication\
    \ preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. In a short list of facts about\
    \ his life he submitted to the National Academy of Sciences, he stated \"The part\
    \ of my work I consider most essential is that on quantum mechanics, which developed\

  question: What was the topic of Von Neumann's work at Princeton in 1931 - 32?
- answer: adjustable-rate mortgage
  context: The Fed then raised the Fed funds rate significantly between July 2004
    and July 2006. This contributed to an increase in 1-year and 5-year adjustable-rate
    mortgage (ARM) rates, making ARM interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners.
    This may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble, as asset
    prices generally move inversely to interest rates, and it became riskier to speculate
    in housing. U.S. housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after
    the housing bubble burst.
  question: 'What does ARM stand for:'

  context: "During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties\
    \ led by Edgeworth David became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the\
    \ South Magnetic Pole. Douglas Mawson, who assumed the leadership of the Magnetic\
    \ Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until\
    \ retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of\
    \ his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 \u2013 February 1909: they\
    \ were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf, the first to traverse\
    \ the Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set\
    \ foot on the South Polar Plateau. An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer\
    \ Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram became the first to reach the geographic South\
    \ Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel\
    \ Heiberg Glacier. One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole."
  question: Who led the party to first climb Mount Erebus?
- answer: Tokyo
  context: The New York City Fire Department (FDNY), provides fire protection, technical
    rescue, primary response to biological, chemical, and radioactive hazards, and
    emergency medical services for the five boroughs of New York City. The New York
    City Fire Department is the largest municipal fire department in the United States
    and the second largest in the world after the Tokyo Fire Department. The FDNY
    employs approximately 11,080 uniformed firefighters and over 3,300 uniformed EMTs
    and paramedics. The FDNY's motto is New York's Bravest.
  question: What city is home to the largest municipal fire department in the world?
- answer: she dedicated the next two decades to the consolidation of her administration.
  context: 'Not only that, Austria now found herself estranged with the new developments
    within the empire itself. Beside the rise of Prussia, Augustus III, although ineffective,
    could mustered up an army not only from Saxony, but also Poland, considering the
    elector was also the King of Poland. Bavaria''s growing power and independence
    was also apparent as she had more voices on the path that its army should have
    taken, and managed to slip out of the war at its own will. Most importantly, with
    the now somehow-belligerent Hanover united personally under George III of Great
    Britain, It can amassed a considerable power, even brought Britain in, on the
    future conflicts. This power dynamic is important to the future and the latter
    conflicts of the empire. The war also proved that Maria Theresa''s reforms were
    still not enough to compete with Prussia: unlike its enemy, the Austrians went
    almost bankrupt at the end of war. Hence, she dedicated the next two decades to
    the consolidation of her administration.'
  question: How much military aggression did Maria Theresa exert following the war?
- answer: 1870 and 1930
  context: "The port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded.\
    \ It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect\
    \ the harbour entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other\
    \ great port of R\xEDo de la Plata, Buenos Aires. The main engineering work on\
    \ the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the\
    \ construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada,\
    \ the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin\
    \ and the La Teja refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many\
    \ of the city's engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century,\
    \ physical changes have ceased, and since that time the area has degraded due\
    \ to national economic stagnation."
  question: Between what years did the main engineering work on the port of Montevideo
    Bay take place?
- answer: energy cost
  context: "Many, if not most, birds migrate in flocks. For larger birds, flying in\
    \ flocks reduces the energy cost. Geese in a V-formation may conserve 12\u2013\
    20% of the energy they would need to fly alone. Red knots Calidris canutus and\
    \ dunlins Calidris alpina were found in radar studies to fly 5 km/h (3.1 mph)\
    \ faster in flocks than when they were flying alone."
  question: What does flying in flocks reduce?
- answer: June 14
  context: "In the spring of 1800, Napoleon and his troops crossed the Swiss Alps\
    \ into Italy, aiming to surprise the Austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula\
    \ when Napoleon was still in Egypt.[note 5] After a difficult crossing over the\
    \ Alps, the French army entered the plains of Northern Italy virtually unopposed.\
    \ While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with\
    \ another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce\
    \ resistance of this French army, under Andr\xE9 Mass\xE9na, gave the northern\
    \ striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference.\
    \ After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies finally collided\
    \ at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas had a numerical advantage,\
    \ fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French\
    \ troops. The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack\
    \ surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas concluded that he'd\
    \ won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm, leaving his subordinates\
    \ in charge of pursuing the French. However, the French lines never broke during\
    \ their tactical retreat; Napoleon constantly rode out among the troops urging\
    \ them to stand and fight. Late in the afternoon, a full division under Desaix\
    \ arrived on the field and dramatically reversed the tide of the battle. A series\
    \ of artillery barrages and fortunate cavalry charges managed to decimate the\
    \ Austrian army, which fled chaotically over the Bormida River back to Alessandria,\
    \ leaving behind 14,000 casualties. The following day, the Austrian army agreed\
    \ to abandon Northern Italy once more with the Convention of Alessandria, which\
    \ granted them safe passage to friendly soil in exchange for their fortresses\
    \ throughout the region."
  question: What was the date of the Battle of Marengo?
- answer: Germany
  context: "From outside the United Kingdom and the United States, the Canadian trio\
    \ Rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974\u201375 (Rush, Fly\
    \ by Night and Caress of Steel) before moving toward a more progressive sound\
    \ with the 1976 album 2112. The Irish band Thin Lizzy, which had formed in the\
    \ late 1960s, made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with\
    \ the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit \"The Boys Are Back in\
    \ Town\", which reached number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US. Their style,\
    \ consisting of two duelling guitarists often playing leads in harmony, proved\
    \ itself to be a large influence on later bands. They reached their commercial,\
    \ and arguably their artistic peak with Black Rose: A Rock Legend (1979). The\
    \ arrival of Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre.\
    \ Australian-formed AC/DC, with a stripped back, riff heavy and abrasive style\
    \ that also appealed to the punk generation, began to gain international attention\
    \ from 1976, culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There\
    \ Be Rock (1977) and Highway to Hell (1979). Also influenced by a punk ethos were\
    \ heavy metal bands like Mot\xF6rhead, while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining\
    \ elements of the blues in their music, further differentiating the hard rock\
    \ and heavy metal styles and helping to create the New Wave of British Heavy Metal\
    \ which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden, Saxon and Venom."
  question: The Scorpions hailed from what country?
- answer: distribution of light released
  context: The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA), in conjunction
    with organizations like ANSI and ASHRAE, publishes guidelines, standards, and
    handbooks that allow categorization of the illumination needs of different built
    environments. Manufacturers of lighting equipment publish photometric data for
    their products, which defines the distribution of light released by a specific
    luminaire. This data is typically expressed in standardized form defined by the
    IESNA.
  question: What defines photo metric data?
- answer: alchemy
  context: 'Ancient Egypt made significant advances in astronomy, mathematics and
    medicine. Their development of geometry was a necessary outgrowth of surveying
    to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland, which was flooded annually by
    the Nile river. The 3-4-5 right triangle and other rules of thumb were used to
    build rectilinear structures, and the post and lintel architecture of Egypt. Egypt
    was also a center of alchemy research for much of the Mediterranean.The Edwin
    Smith papyrus is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps
    the earliest document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain: it might
    be seen as the very beginnings of modern neuroscience. However, while Egyptian
    medicine had some effective practices, it was not without its ineffective and
    sometimes harmful practices. Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian
    pharmacology, for example, was largely ineffective. Nevertheless, it applies the
    following components to the treatment of disease: examination, diagnosis, treatment,
    and prognosis, which display strong parallels to the basic empirical method of
    science and according to G. E. R. Lloyd played a significant role in the development
    of this methodology. The Ebers papyrus (c. 1550 BC) also contains evidence of
    traditional empiricism.'
  question: What research was Egypt known for?
- answer: A Theory of Justice
  context: "From the end of World War II until 1971, when John Rawls published A Theory\
    \ of Justice, political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world,\
    \ as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative\
    \ judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical\
    \ methods and behavioralism. In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar\
    \ decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with Marxism dominating\
    \ the field. This was the time of Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Althusser, and the\
    \ victories of Mao Zedong in China and Fidel Castro in Cuba, as well as the events\
    \ of May 1968 led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially\
    \ by the New Left. A number of continental European \xE9migr\xE9s to Britain and\
    \ the United States\u2014including Karl Popper, Friedrich Hayek, Leo Strauss,\
    \ Isaiah Berlin, Eric Voegelin and Judith Shklar\u2014encouraged continued study\
    \ in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s\
    \ they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment."
  question: What did John Rawls publish?
- answer: from the rising of Joseon Dynasty to the enthronement of King Gojong
  context: In Asia, various Chinese dynasties and Japanese shogunates controlled the
    Asian sphere. In Japan, the Edo period from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as
    the early modern period. And in Korea, from the rising of Joseon Dynasty to the
    enthronement of King Gojong is referred to as the early modern period. In the
    Americas, Native Americans had built a large and varied civilization, including
    the Aztec Empire and alliance, the Inca civilization, the Mayan Empire and cities,
    and the Chibcha Confederation. In the west, the European kingdoms and movements
    were in a movement of reformation and expansion. Russia reached the Pacific coast
    in 1647 and consolidated its control over the Russian Far East in the 19th century.
  question: What is time is considered the "Modern Period" in Korea?
- answer: Russia
  context: Yongzheng also inherited diplomatic and strategic problems. A team made
    up entirely of Manchus drew up the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727) to solidify the diplomatic
    understanding with Russia. In exchange for territory and trading rights, the Qing
    would have a free hand dealing with the situation in Mongolia. Yongzheng then
    turned to that situation, where the Zunghars threatened to re-emerge, and to the
    southwest, where local Miao chieftains resisted Qing expansion. These campaigns
    drained the treasury but established the emperor's control of the military and
    military finance.
  question: Who was the partner in the Treaty of Kyakhta?
- answer: Persian Sassanid Empire
  context: "The Quran and Muhammad talked about racial equality and justice as in\
    \ The Farewell Sermon. Tribal and nationalistic differences were discouraged.\
    \ But after Muhammad's passing, the old tribal differences between the Arabs started\
    \ to resurface. Following the Roman\u2013Persian Wars and the Byzantine\u2013\
    Sassanid Wars, deep rooted differences between Iraq, formally under the Persian\
    \ Sassanid Empire, and Syria, formally under the Byzantine Empire, also existed.\
    \ Each wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic State to be in their\
    \ area. Previously, the second caliph Umar was very firm on the governors and\
    \ his spies kept an eye on them. If he felt that a governor or a commander was\
    \ becoming attracted to wealth, he had him removed from his position."
  question: Who controlled Iraq before the Arabs?
- answer: two f-shaped soundholes like a violin (F-5 and A-5), or an oval sound hole
    (F-4 and A-4 and lower models)
  context: These styles generally have either two f-shaped soundholes like a violin
    (F-5 and A-5), or an oval sound hole (F-4 and A-4 and lower models) directly under
    the strings. Much variation exists between makers working from these archetypes,
    and other variants have become increasingly common. Generally, in the United States,
    Gibson F-hole F-5 mandolins and mandolins influenced by that design are strongly
    associated with bluegrass, while the A-style is associated other types of music,
    although it too is most often used for and associated with bluegrass. The F-5's
    more complicated woodwork also translates into a more expensive instrument.
  question: What shape sounds holes do these styles of mandolins have?
- answer: The abomasum
  context: The abomasum is the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants.
    It is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach (e.g., those in humans or pigs),
    and digesta is processed here in much the same way. It serves primarily as a site
    for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein
    sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine. Digesta is
    finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of
    nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in
    the small intestine.
  question: What is the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants?
- answer: Senior Chief Deputy Whip
  context: The Chief Deputy Whip is the primary assistant to the whip, who is the
    chief vote counter for his or her party. The current chief deputy majority whip
    is Republican Patrick McHenry. Within the House Republican Conference, the chief
    deputy whip is the highest appointed position and often a launching pad for future
    positions in the House Leadership. The House Democratic Conference has multiple
    chief deputy whips, led by a Senior Chief Deputy Whip, which is the highest appointed
    position within the House Democratic Caucus. The current senior chief deputy minority
    whip, John Lewis, has held his post since 1991.
  question: Who is the leader of chief deputy whips in democratic conference?
- answer: '1976'
  context: "Heitaro Nakajima, who developed an early digital audio recorder within\
    \ Japan's national public broadcasting organization NHK in 1970, became general\
    \ manager of Sony's audio department in 1971. His team developed a digital PCM\
    \ adaptor audio tape recorder using a Betamax video recorder in 1973. After this,\
    \ in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made.\
    \ Sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in September\
    \ 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a 30 cm disc that\
    \ could play 60 minutes of digital audio (44,100 Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution)\
    \ using MFM modulation. In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical\
    \ digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056 Hz sampling rate,\
    \ 16-bit linear resolution, and cross-interleaved error correction code\u2014\
    specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard Compact Disc\
    \ format in 1980. Technical details of Sony's digital audio disc were presented\
    \ during the 62nd AES Convention, held on 13\u201316 March 1979, in Brussels.\
    \ Sony's AES technical paper was published on 1 March 1979. A week later, on 8\
    \ March, Philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio\
    \ disc at a press conference called \"Philips Introduce Compact Disc\" in Eindhoven,\
    \ Netherlands."
  question: What year did Sony first exhibit the use of an optical digital audio disc?
- answer: Mycenaean Greece
  context: The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years, beginning in
    Mycenaean Greece and continuing most notably into Classical Greece, through the
    influence of the Roman Empire and its Greek Eastern continuation, the Eastern
    Roman or Byzantine Empire. Other cultures and nations, such as the Latin and Frankish
    states, the Ottoman Empire, the Venetian Republic, the Genoese Republic, and the
    British Empire have also left their influence on modern Greek culture, although
    historians credit the Greek War of Independence with revitalising Greece and giving
    birth to a single, cohesive entity of its multi-faceted culture.
  question: Where did Greece culture begin?
- answer: Fourth Eclogue
  context: "The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized\
    \ Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard\
    \ texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets\
    \ following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning\
    \ in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the\
    \ Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1\u20132, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14\
    \ of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly\
    \ important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic,\
    \ the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with\
    \ the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically\
    \ from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid\
    \ engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem\
    \ not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\"\
    \ In Silius Italicus, Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers. With almost\
    \ every line of his epic Punica Silius references Virgil. Indeed, Silius is known\
    \ to have bought Virgil's tomb and worshipped the poet. Partially as a result\
    \ of his so-called \"Messianic\" Fourth Eclogue\u2014widely interpreted later\
    \ to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ\u2014Virgil was in later antiquity\
    \ imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer; the Sortes Vergilianae, the\
    \ process of using Virgil's poetry as a tool of divination, is found in the time\
    \ of Hadrian, and continued into the Middle Ages. In a similar vein Macrobius\
    \ in the Saturnalia credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge\
    \ and experience, mirroring the Greek conception of Homer. Virgil also found commentators\
    \ in antiquity. Servius, a commentator of the 4th century AD, based his work on\
    \ the commentary of Donatus. Servius' commentary provides us with a great deal\
    \ of information about Virgil's life, sources, and references; however, many modern\
    \ scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations\
    \ frustrating."
  question: Which of Virgil's works was later widely interpreted to have predicted
    the birth of Jesus Christ?
- answer: 76%
  context: 'According to Ethnologue, the lexical similarity between Catalan and other
    Romance languages is: 87% with Italian; 85% with Portuguese; 80% with Spanish;
    76% with Ladin; 75% with Sardinian; and 73% with Romanian.'
  question: What is the relationship similarity to Ladin?
- answer: '"Reorganized National Government of China"'
  context: A few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China
    was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese
    resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the "Nanjing
    Regime" or "Reorganized National Government of China" led by Wang Jingwei was
    established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Chongqing.
    In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government
    back to Nanjing.
  question: What was another name for the Nanjing Regime?
- answer: from conception to death.
  context: "Rebirth refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of\
    \ lifetimes as one of many possible forms of sentient life, each running from\
    \ conception to death. The doctrine of anatt\u0101 (Sanskrit an\u0101tman) rejects\
    \ the concepts of a permanent self or an unchanging, eternal soul, as it is called\
    \ in Hinduism and Christianity. According to Buddhism there ultimately is no such\
    \ thing as a self independent from the rest of the universe. Buddhists also refer\
    \ to themselves as the believers of the anatta doctrine\u2014Nairatmyavadin or\
    \ Anattavadin. Rebirth in subsequent existences must be understood as the continuation\
    \ of a dynamic, ever-changing process of prat\u012Btyasamutp\u0101da (\"dependent\
    \ arising\") determined by the laws of cause and effect (karma) rather than that\
    \ of one being, reincarnating from one existence to the next."
  question: Sentient life according to Buddhism runs between what two points?
- answer: the eastern waterfront in Buceo
  context: "There are also other types of museums in the city. The Museo del Gaucho\
    \ y de la Moneda, located in the Centro, has distinctive displays of the historical\
    \ culture of Uruguay's gauchos, their horse gear, silver work and mate (tea),\
    \ gourds, and bombillas (drinking straws) in odd designs. The Museo Naval, is\
    \ located on the eastern waterfront in Buceo and offers exhibits depicting the\
    \ maritime history of Uruguay. The Museo del Autom\xF3vil, belonging to the Automobile\
    \ Club of Uruguay, has a rich collection of vintage cars which includes a 1910\
    \ Hupmobile. The Museo y Parque Fernando Garc\xEDa in Carrasco, a transport and\
    \ automobile museum, includes old horse carriages and some early automobiles.\
    \ The Castillo Pittamiglio, with an unusual fa\xE7ade, highlights the eccentric\
    \ legacy of Humberto Pittamiglio, local alchemist and architect."
  question: Where is the Museo Naval located?
- answer: earthquake emergency relief
  context: An earthquake emergency relief team of 184 people (consisting of 12 people
    from the State Seismological Bureau, 150 from the Beijing Military Area Command,
    and 22 from the Armed Police General Hospital) left Beijing from Nanyuan Airport
    late May 12 in two military transport planes to travel to Wenchuan County.
  question: What kind of team left Beijing to go to Wenchuan?
- answer: China
  context: "NigeriaSat-2, Nigeria's second satellite, was built as a high-resolution\
    \ earth satellite by Surrey Space Technology Limited, a United Kingdom-based satellite\
    \ technology company. It has 2.5-metre resolution panchromatic (very high resolution),\
    \ 5-metre multispectral (high resolution, NIR red, green and red bands), and 32-metre\
    \ multispectral (medium resolution, NIR red, green and red bands) antennas, with\
    \ a ground receiving station in Abuja. The NigeriaSat-2 spacecraft alone was built\
    \ at a cost of over \xA335 million. This satellite was launched into orbit from\
    \ a military base in China."
  question: Where was Nigeria's second satellite launched?
- answer: gin
  context: Under a banner of "reducing public drunkenness" the Beer Act of 1830 introduced
    a new lower tier of premises permitted to sell alcohol, the Beer Houses. At the
    time beer was viewed as harmless, nutritious and even healthy. Young children
    were often given what was described as small beer, which was brewed to have a
    low alcohol content, as the local water was often unsafe. Even the evangelical
    church and temperance movements of the day viewed the drinking of beer very much
    as a secondary evil and a normal accompaniment to a meal. The freely available
    beer was thus intended to wean the drinkers off the evils of gin, or so the thinking
    went.
  question: What alcohol was regarded as evil when compared to beer?
- answer: the Americans
  context: In April 1950, Stalin gave Kim permission to invade the South under the
    condition that Mao would agree to send reinforcements if they became needed. Stalin
    made it clear that Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a
    direct war with the Americans. Kim met with Mao in May 1950. Mao was concerned
    that the Americans would intervene but agreed to support the North Korean invasion.
    China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets.
    At that time, the Chinese were in the process of demobilizing half of the PLA's
    5.6 million soldiers. However, Mao sent more ethnic Korean PLA veterans to Korea
    and promised to move an army closer to the Korean border. Once Mao's commitment
    was secured, preparations for war accelerated.
  question: Who did the Soviets not want to engage in conflict?
- answer: Access to canals and rivers
  context: Walking is a popular recreational activity in London. Areas that provide
    for walks include Wimbledon Common, Epping Forest, Hampton Court Park, Hampstead
    Heath, the eight Royal Parks, canals and disused railway tracks. Access to canals
    and rivers has improved recently, including the creation of the Thames Path, some
    28 miles (45 km) of which is within Greater London, and The Wandle Trail; this
    runs 12 miles (19 km) through South London along the River Wandle, a tributary
    of the River Thames. Other long distance paths, linking green spaces, have also
    been created, including the Capital Ring, the Green Chain Walk, London Outer Orbital
    Path ("Loop"), Jubilee Walkway, Lea Valley Walk, and the Diana, Princess of Wales
    Memorial Walk.
  question: What recent improvements has served to enhance the walking experience?
- answer: genetics
  context: "The 150th anniversary of Bell's birth in 1997 was marked by a special\
    \ issue of commemorative \xA31 banknotes from the Royal Bank of Scotland. The\
    \ illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell's face in profile, his\
    \ signature, and objects from Bell's life and career: users of the telephone over\
    \ the ages; an audio wave signal; a diagram of a telephone receiver; geometric\
    \ shapes from engineering structures; representations of sign language and the\
    \ phonetic alphabet; the geese which helped him to understand flight; and the\
    \ sheep which he studied to understand genetics. Additionally, the Government\
    \ of Canada honored Bell in 1997 with a C$100 gold coin, in tribute also to the\
    \ 150th anniversary of his birth, and with a silver dollar coin in 2009 in honor\
    \ of the 100th anniversary of flight in Canada. That first flight was made by\
    \ an airplane designed under Dr. Bell's tutelage, named the Silver Dart. Bell's\
    \ image, and also those of his many inventions have graced paper money, coinage\
    \ and postal stamps in numerous countries worldwide for many dozens of years."
  question: What do the sheep on the Scottish banknote represent?
- answer: 17 million
  context: "Established acts benefited from the new commercial climate, with Whitesnake's\
    \ self-titled album (1987) selling over 17 million copies, outperforming anything\
    \ in Coverdale's or Deep Purple's catalogue before or since. It featured the rock\
    \ anthem \"Here I Go Again '87\" as one of 4 UK top 20 singles. The follow-up\
    \ Slip of the Tongue (1989) went platinum, but according to critics Steve Erlwine\
    \ and Greg Prato, \"it was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board\
    \ success of Whitesnake\". Aerosmith's comeback album Permanent Vacation (1987)\
    \ would begin a decade long revival of their popularity. Crazy Nights (1987) by\
    \ Kiss was the band's highest charting release in the US since 1979 and the highest\
    \ of their career in the UK. M\xF6tley Cr\xFCe with Girls, Girls, Girls (1987)\
    \ continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria (1987) hit\
    \ their commercial peak, the latter producing seven hit singles (a record for\
    \ a hard rock act). Guns N' Roses released the best-selling d\xE9but of all time,\
    \ Appetite for Destruction (1987). With a \"grittier\" and \"rawer\" sound than\
    \ most glam metal, it produced three top 10 hits, including the number one \"\
    Sweet Child O' Mine\". Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s,\
    \ such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this\
    \ period with their respective albums Pride (1987) and Long Cold Winter (1988)\
    \ both going multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles. In the last\
    \ years of the decade, the most notable successes were New Jersey (1988) by Bon\
    \ Jovi, OU812 (1988) by Van Halen, Open Up and Say... Ahh! (1988) by Poison, Pump\
    \ (1989) by Aerosmith, and M\xF6tley Cr\xFCe's most commercially successful album\
    \ Dr. Feelgood (1989). New Jersey spawned five Top 10 singles, a record for a\
    \ hard rock act. In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November, the number one spot on the\
    \ Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive\
    \ weeks; the albums were OU812, Hysteria, Appetite for Destruction, and New Jersey.\
    \ A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s, and experienced success\
    \ with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s,\
    \ among them Extreme, Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse. Skid Row also released\
    \ their eponymous d\xE9but (1989), reaching number six on the Billboard 200, but\
    \ they were to be one of the last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era."
  question: How many copies did Whitesnake's 1987 self title album sell?
- answer: chemotherapeutic
  context: Although not yet tested as a therapy in humans, a growing body of evidence
    indicates that zinc may preferentially kill prostate cancer cells. Because zinc
    naturally homes to the prostate and because the prostate is accessible with relatively
    non-invasive procedures, its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent in this type
    of cancer has shown promise. However, other studies have demonstrated that chronic
    use of zinc supplements in excess of the recommended dosage may actually increase
    the chance of developing prostate cancer, also likely due to the natural buildup
    of this heavy metal in the prostate.
  question: What type of agent is zync useful as against prostate cancer?

- answer: Musicam
  context: "In 1991, there were only two proposals available that could be completely\
    \ assessed for an MPEG audio standard: Musicam (Masking pattern adapted Universal\
    \ Subband Integrated Coding And Multiplexing) and ASPEC (Adaptive Spectral Perceptual\
    \ Entropy Coding). The Musicam technique, as proposed by Philips (the Netherlands),\
    \ CCETT (France) and Institut f\xFCr Rundfunktechnik (Germany) was chosen due\
    \ to its simplicity and error robustness, as well as its low computational power\
    \ associated with the encoding of high quality compressed audio. The Musicam format,\
    \ based on sub-band coding, was the basis of the MPEG Audio compression format\
    \ (sampling rates, structure of frames, headers, number of samples per frame)."
  question: Other than ASPEC what was another proposal?
- answer: '2001'
  context: Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when
    the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the
    headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's
    Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and
    the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the
    747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains
    based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington.
  question: When did Boeing move its headquarters to Chicago?
- answer: domes
  context: Internal courtyards became more rare, except beside the stables, and the
    functional parts of the building were placed at the sides, or in separate buildings
    nearby hidden by trees. The views to and from the front and rear of the main block
    were concentrated on, with the side approaches usually much less important. The
    roof was typically invisible from the ground, though domes were sometimes visible
    in grander buildings. The roofline was generally clear of ornament except for
    a balustrade or the top of a pediment. Columns or pilasters, often topped by a
    pediment, were popular for ornament inside and out, and other ornament was generally
    geometrical or plant-based, rather than using the human figure.
  question: What was occasionally visible in grander buildings?
- answer: Shan migrants who arrived with the Mongol invasions stayed behind
  context: Pagan's collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that
    lasted well into the 16th century. Like the Burmans four centuries earlier, Shan
    migrants who arrived with the Mongol invasions stayed behind. Several competing
    Shan States came to dominate the entire northwestern to eastern arc surrounding
    the Irrawaddy valley. The valley too was beset with petty states until the late
    14th century when two sizeable powers, Ava Kingdom and Hanthawaddy Kingdom, emerged.
    In the west, a politically fragmented Arakan was under competing influences of
    its stronger neighbours until the Kingdom of Mrauk U unified the Arakan coastline
    for the first time in 1437.
  question: Did the Mongol invasions of Burma leave any lasting signs?
- answer: shallow
  context: The terms upper case and lower case can be written as two consecutive words,
    connected with a hyphen (upper-case and lower-case), or as a single word (uppercase
    and lowercase). These terms originated from the common layouts of the shallow
    drawers called type cases used to hold the movable type for letterpress printing.
    Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate case that was located
    above the case that held the small letters, and the name proved easy to remember
    since capital letters are taller.
  question: The terms uppercase and lowercase originated from the common layout which
    type of drawers?
- answer: suffering
  context: "Impermanence (P\u0101li: anicca) expresses the Buddhist notion that all\
    \ compounded or conditioned phenomena (all things and experiences) are inconstant,\
    \ unsteady, and impermanent. Everything we can experience through our senses is\
    \ made up of parts, and its existence is dependent on external conditions. Everything\
    \ is in constant flux, and so conditions and the thing itself are constantly changing.\
    \ Things are constantly coming into being, and ceasing to be. Since nothing lasts,\
    \ there is no inherent or fixed nature to any object or experience. According\
    \ to the doctrine of impermanence, life embodies this flux in the aging process,\
    \ the cycle of rebirth (sa\u1E43s\u0101ra), and in any experience of loss. The\
    \ doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent, attachment to them is\
    \ futile and leads to suffering (dukkha)."
  question: According to doctrine, because all thing don't last, attachment can lead
    to what?
- answer: parties from using religion as a basis for political activity
  context: Constitutional changes voted on 19 March 2007 prohibited parties from using
    religion as a basis for political activity, allowed the drafting of a new anti-terrorism
    law, authorised broad police powers of arrest and surveillance, and gave the president
    power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring. In 2009, Dr.
    Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki, Media Secretary of the National Democratic Party (NDP),
    described Egypt as a "pharaonic" political system, and democracy as a "long-term
    goal". Dessouki also stated that "the real center of power in Egypt is the military".
  question: What did constitutional changes in 2007 prohibit?
- answer: influence
  context: As a non-directive and flexible analytical tool, the concept of boundaries
    helps both to map and to define the changeability and mutability that are characteristic
    of people's experiences of the self in society. While identity is a volatile,
    flexible and abstract 'thing', its manifestations and the ways in which it is
    exercised are often open to view. Identity is made evident through the use of
    markers such as language, dress, behaviour and choice of space, whose effect depends
    on their recognition by other social beings. Markers help to create the boundaries
    that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker
    perceivers, their effectiveness depends on a shared understanding of their meaning.
    In a social context, misunderstandings can arise due to a misinterpretation of
    the significance of specific markers. Equally, an individual can use markers of
    identity to exert influence on other people without necessarily fulfilling all
    the criteria that an external observer might typically associate with such an
    abstract identity.
  question: Markers can be used to exert what on other people?
- answer: seven
  context: "Catalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven\
    \ stressed phonemes: /a \u025B e i \u0254 o u/, a common feature in Western Romance,\
    \ except Spanish. Balearic has also instances of stressed /\u0259/. Dialects differ\

    \ e/."
  question: How many stressed phonemes are there in Catalan?

  question: What arboretum is located in Raleigh?
- answer: '675'
  context: Between 1836 and 1842 Victorian Aboriginal groups were largely dispossessed[by
    whom?] of their land. By January 1844, there were said to be 675 Aborigines resident
    in squalid camps in Melbourne. The British Colonial Office appointed five Aboriginal
    Protectors for the Aborigines of Victoria, in 1839, however their work was nullified
    by a land policy that favoured squatters to take possession of Aboriginal lands.
    By 1845, fewer than 240 wealthy Europeans held all the pastoral licences then
    issued in Victoria and became a powerful political and economic force in Victoria
    for generations to come.
  question: How many Aborigines were said to be resident in squalid camps in Melbourne
    in January 1844?
- answer: sickle blades and grinding stones
  context: Neolithic people were skilled farmers, manufacturing a range of tools necessary
    for the tending, harvesting and processing of crops (such as sickle blades and
    grinding stones) and food production (e.g. pottery, bone implements). They were
    also skilled manufacturers of a range of other types of stone tools and ornaments,
    including projectile points, beads, and statuettes. But what allowed forest clearance
    on a large scale was the polished stone axe above all other tools. Together with
    the adze, fashioning wood for shelter, structures and canoes for example, this
    enabled them to exploit their newly won farmland.
  question: What types of tools did early farmers use for crops?
- answer: 23,000
  context: By 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld.
    Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in
    hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21
    May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating
    the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority
    over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000
    soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements
    had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious
    back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal
    points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost
    Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment
    eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both
    sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other. It was the first defeat
    Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout
    many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.
  question: Around how many casualties did the French experience at the Battle of
    Aspern-Essling?
- answer: cracks on walls
  context: Reporters in Chengdu said they saw cracks on walls of some residential
    buildings in the downtown areas, but no buildings collapsed. Many Beijing office
    towers were evacuated, including the building housing the media offices for the
    organizers of the 2008 Summer Olympics. None of the Olympic venues were damaged.
    Meanwhile, a cargo train carrying 13 petrol tanks derailed in Hui County, Gansu,
    and caught on fire after the rail was distorted.
  question: What was reported in Chengdu?
- answer: mind-independent
  context: "In philosophy, idealism is the group of philosophies which assert that\
    \ reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed,\
    \ or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism\
    \ about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological\
    \ sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas\u2014especially beliefs and values\u2014\
    shape society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that\
    \ all entities are composed of mind or spirit. Idealism thus rejects physicalist\
    \ and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind."
  question: What types of things are idealist philosophies skeptical about?
- answer: Boston Common
  context: Boston Common, located near the Financial District and Beacon Hill, is
    the oldest public park in the United States. Along with the adjacent Boston Public
    Garden, it is part of the Emerald Necklace, a string of parks designed by Frederick
    Law Olmsted to encircle the city. The Emerald Necklace includes Jamaica Pond,
    Boston's largest body of freshwater, and Franklin Park, the city's largest park
    and home of the Franklin Park Zoo. Another major park is the Esplanade, located
    along the banks of the Charles River. The Hatch Shell, an outdoor concert venue,
    is located adjacent to the Charles River Esplanade. Other parks are scattered
    throughout the city, with the major parks and beaches located near Castle Island;
    in Charlestown; and along the Dorchester, South Boston, and East Boston shorelines.
  question: What is the oldest public park in the US?
- answer: storage & supply depots
  context: The defence estate is divided as training areas & ranges (84.0%), research
    & development (5.4%), airfields (3.4%), barracks & camps (2.5%), storage & supply
    depots (1.6%), and other (3.0%). These are largely managed by the Defence Infrastructure
    Organisation.
  question: What makes up the smallest portion of the defence estate?
- answer: Wafd
  context: "In the 1950 parliamentary elections, the Wafd Party of el-Nahhas gained\
    \ a victory\u2014mostly due to the absence of the Muslim Brotherhood, which boycotted\
    \ the elections\u2014and was perceived as a threat by the Free Officers as the\
    \ Wafd had campaigned on demands similar to their own. Accusations of corruption\
    \ against Wafd politicians began to surface, however, breeding an atmosphere of\
    \ rumor and suspicion that consequently brought the Free Officers to the forefront\
    \ of Egyptian politics. By then, the organization had expanded to around ninety\
    \ members; according to Khaled Mohieddin, \"nobody knew all of them and where\
    \ they belonged in the hierarchy except Nasser\". Nasser felt that the Free Officers\
    \ were not ready to move against the government and, for nearly two years, he\
    \ did little beyond officer recruitment and underground news bulletins."
  question: What party advanced in the 1950 elections?
- answer: Kara DioGuardi
  context: In the first major change to the judging panel, a fourth judge, Kara DioGuardi,
    was introduced. This was also the first season without executive producer Nigel
    Lythgoe who left to focus on the international versions of his show So You Think
    You Can Dance. The Hollywood round was moved to the Kodak Theatre for 2009 and
    was also extended to two weeks. Idol Gives Back was canceled for this season due
    to the global recession at the time.
  question: Who was brought in as a new judge during American Idols eighth season?
- answer: United Nations Security Council
  context: "When World War II started in 1939, it divided the world into two alliances\u2014\
    the Allies (the United Kingdom and France at first in Europe, China in Asia since\
    \ 1937, followed in 1941 by the Soviet Union, the United States); and the Axis\
    \ powers consisting of Germany, Italy and Japan.[nb 1] During World War II, the\
    \ United States, United Kingdom, and Soviet Union controlled Allied policy and\
    \ emerged as the \"Big Three\". The Republic of China and the Big Three were referred\
    \ as a \"trusteeship of the powerful\"  and were recognized as the Allied \"Big\
    \ Four\" in Declaration by United Nations in 1942. These four countries were referred\
    \ as the \"Four Policemen\" of the Allies and considered as the primary victors\
    \ of World War II. The importance of France was acknowledged by their inclusion,\
    \ along with the other four, in the group of countries allotted permanent seats\
    \ in the United Nations Security Council."
  question: The winners of World War II along with France were allotted permanent
    seats for what organization?
- answer: Plymouth Sound
  context: Plymouth lies between the River Plym to the east and the River Tamar to
    the west; both rivers flow into the natural harbour of Plymouth Sound. Since 1967,
    the unitary authority of Plymouth has included the, once independent, towns of
    Plympton and Plymstock which lie along the east of the River Plym. The River Tamar
    forms the county boundary between Devon and Cornwall and its estuary forms the
    Hamoaze on which is sited Devonport Dockyard.
  question: In what body of water do the rivers Plym and Tamar meet?
- answer: claimed that it was at a loss to understand the allegations
  context: In early August 2008, Iowa Labour Commissioner David Neil announced that
    his department had found that Agriprocessors, a kosher meatpacking company in
    Postville which had recently been raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement,
    had employed 57 minors, some as young as 14, in violation of state law prohibiting
    anyone under 18 from working in a meatpacking plant. Neil announced that he was
    turning the case over to the state Attorney General for prosecution, claiming
    that his department's inquiry had discovered "egregious violations of virtually
    every aspect of Iowa's child labour laws." Agriprocessors claimed that it was
    at a loss to understand the allegations. Agriprocessors' CEO went to trial on
    these charges in state court on 4 May 2010. After a five-week trial he was found
    not guilty of all 57 charges of child labour violations by the Black Hawk County
    District Court jury in Waterloo, Iowa, on 7 June 2010.
  question: What did Agriprocessors say in regards to the allegations?
- answer: wheat
  context: "Species boundaries in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross\
    \ species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha\
    \ \xD7 piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha\
    \ spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat are the result of multiple inter-\
    \ and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms\
    \ with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate\
    \ between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma\
    \ or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods\
    \ used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female\
    \ gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious\
    \ when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to\
    \ bryophyte gametophytes."
  question: What common grain is the result cultivated wild hybrids?
- answer: The construction of gods and spirits like persons
  context: Pascal Boyer argues that while there is a wide array of supernatural concepts
    found around the world, in general, supernatural beings tend to behave much like
    people. The construction of gods and spirits like persons is one of the best known
    traits of religion. He cites examples from Greek mythology, which is, in his opinion,
    more like a modern soap opera than other religious systems. Bertrand du Castel
    and Timothy Jurgensen demonstrate through formalization that Boyer's explanatory
    model matches physics' epistemology in positing not directly observable entities
    as intermediaries. Anthropologist Stewart Guthrie contends that people project
    human features onto non-human aspects of the world because it makes those aspects
    more familiar. Sigmund Freud also suggested that god concepts are projections
    of one's father.
  question: What is one of the most common traits of religion according to Boyer?
- answer: Romulus and Remus
  context: The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through
    an elaborate genealogy (the Latin kings of Alba Longa) with the well-known legend
    of Rome's founding by Romulus and Remus. The most common version of the twins'
    story displays several aspects of hero myth. Their mother, Rhea Silvia, had been
    ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin, in order to preserve the throne
    he had usurped from her father. Through divine intervention, the rightful line
    was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars. She gave birth
    to twins, who were duly exposed by order of the king but saved through a series
    of miraculous events.
  question: What mythical characters were involved in the founding of Rome?
- answer: the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as
    it had applied to other mixtures
  context: 'According to historian Shaye J. D. Cohen, the status of the offspring
    of mixed marriages was determined patrilineally in the Bible. He brings two likely
    explanations for the change in Mishnaic times: first, the Mishnah may have been
    applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures
    (Kil''ayim). Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and
    a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally. Second, the
    Tannaim may have been influenced by Roman law, which dictated that when a parent
    could not contract a legal marriage, offspring would follow the mother.'
  question: What is one explanation for the change in Mishnaic times?
- answer: contradictions
  context: Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, Sociology professor at Duke University, remarks,
    "I contend that racism is, more than anything else, a matter of group power; it
    is about a dominant racial group (whites) striving to maintain its systemic advantages
    and minorities fighting to subvert the racial status quo."  The types of practices
    that take place under this new color-blind racism is subtle, institutionalized,
    and supposedly not racial. Color-blind racism thrives on the idea that race is
    no longer an issue in the United States. There are contradictions between the
    alleged color-blindness of most whites and the persistence of a color-coded system
    of inequality.
  question: What exists between the alleged color-blindness of most whites and the
    persistence of a system of inequality?
- answer: October 15
  context: Violent incidents occurred throughout the Piedmont of the state as white
    insurgents struggled to maintain white supremacy in the face of social changes
    after the war and granting of citizenship to freedmen by federal constitutional
    amendments. After former Confederates were allowed to vote again, election campaigns
    from 1872 on were marked by violent intimidation of blacks and Republicans by
    white Democratic paramilitary groups, known as the Red Shirts. Violent incidents
    took place in Charleston on King Street in September 6 and in nearby Cainhoy on
    October 15, both in association with political meetings before the 1876 election.
    The Cainhoy incident was the only one statewide in which more whites were killed
    than blacks. The Red Shirts were instrumental in suppressing the black Republican
    vote in some areas in 1876 and narrowly electing Wade Hampton as governor, and
    taking back control of the state legislature. Another riot occurred in Charleston
    the day after the election, when a prominent Republican leader was mistakenly
    reported killed.
  question: The Cainhoy Incident occurred on what day?
- answer: Massachusetts
  context: "Boston (pronounced i/\u02C8b\u0252st\u0259n/) is the capital and largest\

- answer: International Agency for Research on Cancer
  context: "Cancer is now common in developing countries. According to a study by\
    \ the International Agency for Research on Cancer, \"In the developing world,\
    \ cancers of the liver, stomach and esophagus were more common, often linked to\
    \ consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods, such as smoked or salted food,\
    \ and parasitic infections that attack organs.\" Lung cancer rates are rising\
    \ rapidly in poorer nations because of increased use of tobacco. Developed countries\
    \ \"tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a 'Western lifestyle' \u2014\

- answer: '"Three Alls Policy" ("Kill all, Burn all, Loot all")'
  context: The war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese
    at Battle of Suixian-Zaoyang and 1st Battle of Changsha. After these victories,
    Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940;
    however, due to its low military-industrial capacity, it was repulsed by Japanese
    army in late March 1940. In August of 1940, Chinese communists launched an offensive
    in Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted the "Three Alls Policy" ("Kill
    all, Burn all, Loot all") in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources
    for the communists. By 1941 the conflict had become a stalemate. Although Japan
    had occupied much of northern, central, and coastal China, the Nationalist Government
    had retreated to the interior with a provisional capital set up at Chungking while
    the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in Shaanxi. In addition,
    Japanese control of northern and central China was somewhat tenuous, in that Japan
    was usually able to control railroads and the major cities ("points and lines"),
    but did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese
    countryside. The Japanese found its aggression against the retreating and regrouping
    Chinese army was stalled by the mountainous terrain in southwestern China while
    the Communists organised widespread guerrilla and saboteur activities in northern
    and eastern China behind the Japanese front line.
  question: What policy did Japan adopt to retaliate against China?
- answer: excessive nationalism
  context: 'The only foreign diplomatic experience Montini underwent was his time
    in the nunciature in Warsaw, Poland in 1923. Like Achille Ratti before him,[a]
    he felt confronted with the huge problem, not limited to Poland, of excessive
    nationalism: "This form of nationalism treats foreigners as enemies, especially
    foreigners with whom one has common frontiers. Then one seeks the expansion of
    one''s own country at the expense of the immediate neighbours. People grow up
    with a feeling of being hemmed in. Peace becomes a transient compromise between
    wars." When he was recalled to Rome he was happy to go, because "this concludes
    this episode of my life, which has provided useful, though not always joyful,
    experiences."'
  question: What political problem did Montini feel he needed to address as a diplomat
    in Poland?
- answer: Netscape Navigator
  context: "In 1993, browser software was further innovated by Marc Andreessen with\
    \ the release of Mosaic, \"the world's first popular browser\", which made the\
    \ World Wide Web system easy to use and more accessible to the average person.\
    \ Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s. The introduction\
    \ of Mosaic in 1993 \u2013 one of the first graphical web browsers \u2013 led\
    \ to an explosion in web use. Andreessen, the leader of the Mosaic team at National\
    \ Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), soon started his own company,\
    \ named Netscape, and released the Mosaic-influenced Netscape Navigator in 1994,\
    \ which quickly became the world's most popular browser, accounting for 90% of\
    \ all web use at its peak (see usage share of web browsers)."
  question: What browser did Andreessen release in 1994?
- answer: '"Through The Wire"'
  context: West's breakthrough came a year later on October 23, 2002, when, while
    driving home from a California recording studio after working late, he fell asleep
    at the wheel and was involved in a near-fatal car crash. The crash left him with
    a shattered jaw, which had to be wired shut in reconstructive surgery. The accident
    inspired West; two weeks after being admitted to the hospital, he recorded a song
    at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut. The composition, "Through
    The Wire", expressed West's experience after the accident, and helped lay the
    foundation for his debut album, as according to West "all the better artists have
    expressed what they were going through". West added that "the album was my medicine",
    as working on the record distracted him from the pain. "Through The Wire" was
    first available on West's Get Well Soon... mixtape, released December 2002. At
    the same time, West announced that he was working on an album called The College
    Dropout, whose overall theme was to "make your own decisions. Don't let society
    tell you, 'This is what you have to do.'"
  question: What song did Kanye record about his experience with what happened after
    the wreck?
- answer: democracy.
  context: There were several protests along the torch relay route. Members of the
    Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, including
    pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, waved novelty inflatable plastic Olympic flames,
    which they said symbolised democracy. They wanted accountability for the Tiananmen
    Square protests of 1989 and the implementation of democracy in Hong Kong. Political
    activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung (Longhair) also joined
    the protest, saying "I'm very proud that in Hong Kong we still have people brave
    enough to speak out." Pro-democracy activists were overwhelmed by a crowd of torch
    supporters with insults like "running dog," "traitor," "get out!," and "I love
    the Communist Party." At the same time, about 10 members of the Civil Human Rights
    Front had orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage.
    Onlookers were saying "Aren't you Chinese?" in Mandarin putonghua as they tried
    to cover the orange banners with a large Chinese national flag. One woman had
    an orange sign that said, "Olympic flame for democracy", while a man carried a
    poster with a tank and the slogan "One world, two dreams". A university student
    and former RDHK radio host Christina Chan wrapped the Tibetan snow lion flag around
    her body and later began waving it. Several onlookers heckled Chan, shouting "What
    kind of Chinese are you?" and "What a shame!" In the end, she and some of the
    protesters were taken away against their will by the authorities via a police
    vehicle "for their own protection." Chan is currently[when?] suing the Hong Kong
    government, claiming her human rights were breached. (case number HCAL139/08)
  question: Some people waved plastic inflated flames, saying they symbolize what?
- answer: April 12, 1861
  context: "Sectional tensions had long existed between the states located north of\
    \ the Mason\u2013Dixon line and those south of it, primarily centered on the \"\
    peculiar institution\" of slavery and the ability of states to overrule the decisions\
    \ of the national government. During the 1840s and 1850s, conflicts between the\
    \ two sides became progressively more violent. After the election of Abraham Lincoln\
    \ in 1860 (who southerners thought would work to end slavery) states in the South\
    \ seceded from the United States, beginning with South Carolina in late 1860.\
    \ On April 12, 1861, forces of the South (known as the Confederate States of America\
    \ or simply the Confederacy) opened fire on Fort Sumter, whose garrison was loyal\
    \ to the Union."
  question: When did Confederate forces bombard Fort Sumter?
- answer: General Ridgway
  context: "General Ridgway was appointed Supreme Commander, Korea; he regrouped the\
    \ UN forces for successful counterattacks, while General James Van Fleet assumed\
    \ command of the U.S. Eighth Army. Further attacks slowly depleted the PVA and\
    \ KPA forces; Operations Courageous (23\u201328 March 1951) and Tomahawk (23 March\
    \ 1951) were a joint ground and airborne infilltration meant to trap Chinese forces\
    \ between Kaesong and Seoul. UN forces advanced to \"Line Kansas\", north of the\
    \ 38th parallel. The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team's (\"Rakkasans\") second\
    \ of two combat jumps was on Easter Sunday, 1951, at Munsan-ni, South Korea, codenamed\
    \ Operation Tomahawk. The mission was to get behind Chinese forces and block their\
    \ movement north. The 60th Indian Parachute Field Ambulance provided the medical\
    \ cover for the operations, dropping an ADS and a surgical team and treating over\
    \ 400 battle casualties apart from the civilian casualties that formed the core\
    \ of their objective as the unit was on a humanitarian mission."
  question: Who was appointed Supreme Commander in Korea after the removal of General
    MacArthur?
- answer: Turkic tribes
  context: The 10th century saw a mass migration of Turkic tribes from Central Asia
    into the Iranian plateau. Turkic tribesmen were first used in the Abbasid army
    as mamluks (slave-warriors), replacing Iranian and Arab elements within the army.
    As a result, the mamluks gained a significant political power. In 999, large portions
    of Iran came briefly under the rule of the Ghaznavids, whose rulers were of mamluk
    Turk origin, and longer subsequently under the Turkish Seljuk and Khwarezmian
    empires. These Turks had been Persianized and had adopted Persian models of administration
    and rulership. The Seljuks subsequently gave rise to the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia,
    while taking their thoroughly Persianized identity with them. The result of the
    adoption and patronage of Persian culture by Turkish rulers was the development
    of a distinct Turko-Persian tradition.
  question: What tribes migranted en masse to the Iranian plateau in the 10th Century?
- answer: personal religion
  context: In the Union of Utrecht of 20 January 1579, Holland and Zeeland were granted
    the right to accept only one religion (in practice, Calvinism). Every other province
    had the freedom to regulate the religious question as it wished, although the
    Union stated every person should be free in the choice of personal religion and
    that no person should be prosecuted based on religious choice. William of Orange
    had been a strong supporter of public and personal freedom of religion and hoped
    to unite Protestants and Catholics in the new union, and, for him, the Union was
    a defeat. In practice, Catholic services in all provinces were quickly forbidden,
    and the Reformed Church became the "public" or "privileged" church in the Republic.
  question: What did the Union state that every person should be free to choose?
- answer: '2012'
  context: 'A number of medications are being studied for multi drug resistant tuberculosis
    including: bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The safety and effectiveness of these
    new agents are still uncertain, because they are based on the results of a relatively
    small studies. However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline
    in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those
    without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health
    policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties
    to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians'' support for its use'
  question: What year did the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approve bedaquiline?
- answer: Filth and Wisdom
  context: Madonna released the song "Hey You" for the Live Earth series of concerts.
    The song was available as a free download during its first week of release. She
    also performed it at the London Live Earth concert. Madonna announced her departure
    from Warner Bros. Records, and a new $120 million, ten-year 360 deal with Live
    Nation. She produced and wrote I Am Because We Are, a documentary on the problems
    faced by Malawians. The documentary was directed by Nathan Rissman, who worked
    as Madonna's gardener. She also directed her first film Filth and Wisdom. The
    plot of the film revolved around three friends and their aspirations. The Times
    said she had "done herself proud" while The Daily Telegraph described the film
    as "not an entirely unpromising first effort [but] Madonna would do well to hang
    on to her day job." In December 2007, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced
    Madonna as one of the five inductees of 2008. At the induction ceremony on March
    10, 2008, Madonna did not sing but asked fellow Hall of Fame inductees and Michigan
    natives The Stooges to perform her songs "Burning Up" and "Ray of Light". She
    thanked Christopher Flynn, her dance teacher from 35 years earlier, for his encouragement
    to follow her dreams.
  question: What is the name of the first film Madonna directed?
- answer: '1415'
  context: In 1353 Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the eight cantons
    of the formative period of 1353 to 1481. Bern invaded and conquered Aargau in
    1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories; thereby becoming
    the largest city-state north of the Alps, by the 18th century comprising most
    of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.
  question: What year did Bern invade Aargau?
- answer: '1962'
  context: Focused by the commitment to a Moon landing, in January 1962 the US announced
    Project Gemini, a two-man spacecraft that would support the later three-man Apollo
    by developing the key spaceflight technologies of space rendezvous and docking
    of two craft, flight durations of sufficient length to simulate going to the Moon
    and back, and extra-vehicular activity to accomplish useful work outside the spacecraft.
  question: What year was the Gemini project confirmed?
- answer: self-rule and separation of powers
  context: Consistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the
    English and the American democracies. In seventeenth-century England, the most
    important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War, Oliver
    Cromwell, John Milton, John Locke, the Glorious Revolution, the English Bill of
    Rights, and the Act of Settlement. Later, the British took their democratic ideals
    to their colonies, e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and India. In North America, Plymouth
    Colony (Pilgrim Fathers; 1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) practised democratic
    self-rule and separation of powers. These Congregationalists were convinced that
    the democratic form of government was the will of God. The Mayflower Compact was
    a social contract.
  question: What democratic principles were followed by the Plymouth Colony?
- answer: pests
  context: New Zealand has a strong hunting culture. The islands making up New Zealand
    originally had no land mammals apart from bats. However, once Europeans arrived,
    game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders
    with sport and a hunting resource. Deer, pigs, goats, rabbits, hare, tahr and
    chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain, and with no natural predators,
    their population exploded. Government agencies view the animals as pests due to
    their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production, but hunters
    view them as a resource.
  question: What do government agencies view the animals as?
- answer: the United Kingdom
  context: Russia feared losing Russian America without compensation in some future
    conflict, especially to the British. While Alaska attracted little interest at
    the time, the population of nearby British Columbia started to increase rapidly
    a few years after hostilities ended. Therefore, the Russian emperor, Alexander
    II, decided to sell Alaska. In 1859 the Russians offered to sell the territory
    to the United States, hoping that its presence in the region would offset the
    plans of Russia's greatest regional rival, the United Kingdom.
  question: Who is Russia's largest regional rival?
- answer: brewing
  context: Women in the Middle Ages were officially required to be subordinate to
    some male, whether their father, husband, or other kinsman. Widows, who were often
    allowed much control over their own lives, were still restricted legally. Women's
    work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant
    women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as
    well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the
    household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also
    expected to help with field-work. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible
    for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women
    varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household,
    and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives,
    but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government
    affairs. The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns, as they were
    unable to become priests.
  question: Along with spinning, what income-producing work did peasant women engage
    in?
- answer: legal
  context: In response to the demonstrations, an editorial in the People's Daily urged
    Chinese people to "express [their] patriotic enthusiasm calmly and rationally,
    and express patriotic aspiration in an orderly and legal manner".
  question: The Chinese people were told to show patriotism in an orderly and what
    manner?
- answer: Congo River
  context: The capital, Brazzaville, is located on the Congo River, in the south of
    the country, immediately across from Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic
    of the Congo.
  question: On what river can Brazzaville be found?
- answer: neutron poison
  context: Uranium-235 was the first isotope that was found to be fissile. Other naturally
    occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow
    neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller
    nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these
    neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs
    that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In
    a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron
    poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials
    are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description
    of this process of reactor control).
  question: What is used to slow a chain reaction in a nuclear reactor?
- answer: sealers
  context: The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas
    situated south of the Antarctic Convergence) were British and American sealers
    who used to spend a year or more on South Georgia, from 1786 onward. During the
    whaling era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from
    over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter.
    Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons.
    The settlements included Grytviken, Leith Harbour, King Edward Point, Stromness,
    Husvik, Prince Olav Harbour, Ocean Harbour and Godthul. Managers and other senior
    officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among
    them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain Carl Anton Larsen, a prominent Norwegian
    whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in
    1910.
  question: What was the profession of the residents of South Georgia?
- answer: 35 million
  context: "Indira Gandhi International Airport, situated to the southwest of Delhi,\
    \ is the main gateway for the city's domestic and international civilian air traffic.\
    \ In 2012-13, the airport was used by more than 35 million passengers, making\
    \ it one of the busiest airports in South Asia. Terminal 3, which cost \u20B9\
    96.8 billion (US$1.4 billion) to construct between 2007 and 2010, handles an additional\
    \ 37 million passengers annually."
  question: Approximately how many passengers used Indira Gandhi Airport from 2012-2013?
- answer: 67:3-4
  context: 'The physicist Abdus Salam, in his Nobel Prize banquet address, quoted
    a well known verse from the Quran (67:3-4) and then stated: "This in effect is
    the faith of all physicists: the deeper we seek, the more is our wonder excited,
    the more is the dazzlement of our gaze". One of Salam''s core beliefs was that
    there is no contradiction between Islam and the discoveries that science allows
    humanity to make about nature and the universe. Salam also held the opinion that
    the Quran and the Islamic spirit of study and rational reflection was the source
    of extraordinary civilizational development. Salam highlights, in particular,
    the work of Ibn al-Haytham and Al-Biruni as the pioneers of empiricism who introduced
    the experimental approach, breaking way from Aristotle''s influence, and thus
    giving birth to modern science. Salam was also careful to differentiate between
    metaphysics and physics, and advised against empirically probing certain matters
    on which "physics is silent and will remain so," such as the doctrine of "creation
    from nothing" which in Salam''s view is outside the limits of science and thus
    "gives way" to religious considerations.'
  question: Which verse from the Quran did Abdus Salam quote at his Nobel banquet?
- answer: Kublai
  context: During his travels beginning in 1403, Deshin Shekpa was induced by further
    exhortations by the Ming court to visit Nanjing by April 10, 1407. Norbu writes
    that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their
    reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards
    Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the
    Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to
    Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and
    on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement
    made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would "sit
    on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric" when receiving religious instructions
    from him.
  question: Who sat on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric?
- answer: her mother
  context: "Beyonc\xE9 announced a hiatus from her music career in January 2010, heeding\
    \ her mother's advice, \"to live life, to be inspired by things again\". During\
    \ the break she and her father parted ways as business partners. Beyonc\xE9's\
    \ musical break lasted nine months and saw her visit multiple European cities,\
    \ the Great Wall of China, the Egyptian pyramids, Australia, English music festivals\
    \ and various museums and ballet performances."
  question: "Who suggested the hiatus for Beyonc\xE9?"
- answer: planned grid
  context: Downtown Boston's streets grew organically, so they do not form a planned
    grid, unlike those in later-developed Back Bay, East Boston, the South End, and
    South Boston. Boston is the eastern terminus of I-90, which in Massachusetts runs
    along the Massachusetts Turnpike. The elevated portion of the Central Artery,
    which carried most of the through traffic in downtown Boston, was replaced with
    the O'Neill Tunnel during the Big Dig, substantially completed in early 2006.
  question: The streets of Back bay grew into a what?
- answer: brisure
  context: Also, the tradition of differentiating between the coat of arms proper
    and a lozenge granted to women did not develop in Poland. Usually men inherited
    the coat of arms from their fathers. Also, the brisure was rarely used.
  question: What was rarely used?
- answer: Pius XII
  context: 'On basic Church teachings, the pope was unwavering. On the tenth anniversary
    of Humanae vitae, he reconfirmed this teaching. In his style and methodology,
    he was a disciple of Pius XII, whom he deeply revered. He suffered for the attacks
    on Pius XII for his alleged silences during the Holocaust. Pope Paul VI was less
    outstanding than his predecessors: he was not credited with an encyclopedic memory,
    nor a gift for languages, nor the brilliant writing style of Pius XII, nor did
    he have the charisma and outpouring love, sense of humor and human warmth of John
    XXIII. He took on himself the unfinished reform work of these two popes, bringing
    them diligently with great humility and common sense and without much fanfare
    to conclusion. In doing so, Paul VI saw himself following in the footsteps of
    the Apostle Paul, torn to several directions as Saint Paul, who said, "I am attracted
    to two sides at once, because the Cross always divides."'
  question: Whose theology did Paul VI continue to propagate during his papacy?
- answer: five days of artillery bombardment
  context: "Later that summer, the Russians invaded Memel with 75,000 troops. Memel\
    \ had one of the strongest fortresses in Prussia. However, after five days of\
    \ artillery bombardment the Russian army was able to storm it. The Russians then\
    \ used Memel as a base to invade East Prussia and defeated a smaller Prussian\
    \ force in the fiercely contested Battle of Gross-J\xE4gersdorf on 30 August 1757.\
    \ However, it was not yet able to take K\xF6nigsberg and retreated soon afterward.\
    \ Still, it was a new threat to Prussia. Not only was Frederick forced to break\
    \ off his invasion of Bohemia, he was now forced to withdraw further into Prussian-controlled\
    \ territory. His defeats on the battlefield brought still more opportunist nations\
    \ into the war. Sweden declared war on Prussia and invaded Pomerania with 17,000\
    \ men. Sweden felt this small army was all that was needed to occupy Pomerania\
    \ and felt the Swedish army would not need to engage with the Prussians because\
    \ the Prussians were occupied on so many other fronts."
  question: What led to the defeat of the Prussians at Memel?
- answer: an independent "responsible government"
  context: In the late 1940s, during the last days of the Dominion of Newfoundland
    (at the time a dominion-dependency in the Commonwealth and independent of Canada),
    there was mainstream support, although not majority, for Newfoundland to form
    an economic union with the United States, thanks to the efforts of the Economic
    Union Party and significant U.S. investment in Newfoundland stemming from the
    U.S.-British alliance in World War II. The movement ultimately failed when, in
    a 1948 referendum, voters narrowly chose to confederate with Canada (the Economic
    Union Party supported an independent "responsible government" that they would
    then push toward their goals).
  question: What did the Economic Union Party support?
- answer: Richard Taruskin
  context: "Some modern commentators have argued against exaggerating Chopin's primacy\
    \ as a \"nationalist\" or \"patriotic\" composer. George Golos refers to earlier\
    \ \"nationalist\" composers in Central Europe, including Poland's Micha\u0142\
    \ Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski and Franciszek Lessel, who utilised polonaise and mazurka\
    \ forms. Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came\
    \ more from \"urbanised\" Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts\
    \ (by Jachimecki and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are\
    \ without basis. Richard Taruskin impugns Schumann's attitude toward Chopin's\
    \ works as patronizing and comments that Chopin \"felt his Polish patriotism deeply\
    \ and sincerely\" but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of Bach,\
    \ Beethoven, Schubert and Field."
  question: Who said Chopin's works were modeled after Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and
    Field?
- answer: third component
  context: "On one hand, this means that the Belgian political landscape, generally\
    \ speaking, consists of only two components: the Dutch-speaking population represented\
    \ by Dutch-language political parties, and the majority populations of Wallonia\
    \ and Brussels, represented by their French-speaking parties. The Brussels region\
    \ emerges as a third component. This specific dual form of federalism, with the\
    \ special position of Brussels, consequently has a number of political issues\u2014\
    even minor ones\u2014that are being fought out over the Dutch/French-language\
    \ political division. With such issues, a final decision is possible only in the\
    \ form of a compromise. This tendency gives this dual federalism model a number\
    \ of traits that generally are ascribed to confederalism, and makes the future\
    \ of Belgian federalism contentious."
  question: What component is the Brussel Region?
- answer: a Czech linguistic revival
  context: "During the revival, in 1809 linguist and historian Josef Dobrovsk\xFD\
    \ released a German-language grammar of Old Czech entitled Ausf\xFChrliches Lehrgeb\xE4\
    ude der b\xF6hmischen Sprache (Comprehensive Doctrine of the Bohemian Language).\
    \ Dobrovsk\xFD had intended his book to be descriptive, and did not think Czech\
    \ had a realistic chance of returning as a major language. However, Josef Jungmann\
    \ and other revivalists used Dobrovsk\xFD's book to advocate for a Czech linguistic\
    \ revival. Changes during this time included spelling reform (notably, \xED in\
    \ place of the former j and j in place of g), the use of t (rather than ti) to\
    \ end infinitive verbs and the non-capitalization of nouns (which had been a late\
    \ borrowing from German). These changes differentiated Czech from Slovak. Modern\
    \ scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated\
    \ by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken Czech unsuitable for formal,\
    \ widespread use."
  question: What did Josef Jungmann advocate for?
- answer: bicycle
  context: The Farmington Canal Trail is a rail trail that will eventually run continuously
    from downtown New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts. The scenic trail follows
    the path of the historic New Haven and Northampton Company and the Farmington
    Canal. Currently, there is a continuous 14-mile (23 km) stretch of the trail from
    downtown, through Hamden and into Cheshire, making bicycle commuting between New
    Haven and those suburbs possible. The trail is part of the East Coast Greenway,
    a proposed 3,000-mile (4,800 km) bike path that would link every major city on
    the East Coast from Florida to Maine.
  question: Part of the rail trail is also accessible by what form of transportation?
- answer: '1981'
  context: 'Meanwhile, Begin''s government provided incentives for Israelis to settle
    in the occupied West Bank, increasing friction with the Palestinians in that area.
    The Basic Law: Jerusalem, the Capital of Israel, passed in 1980, was believed
    by some to reaffirm Israel''s 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree,
    and reignited international controversy over the status of the city. No Israeli
    legislation has defined the territory of Israel and no act specifically included
    East Jerusalem therein. The position of the majority of UN member states is reflected
    in numerous resolutions declaring that actions taken by Israel to settle its citizens
    in the West Bank, and impose its laws and administration on East Jerusalem, are
    illegal and have no validity. In 1981 Israel annexed the Golan Heights, although
    annexation was not recognized internationally.'
  question: When did Israel annex the Golan Heights?
- answer: 267 days
  context: Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941, 16 British cities suffered aerial
    raids with at least 100 long tons of high explosives. Over a period of 267 days,
    London was attacked 71 times, Birmingham, Liverpool and Plymouth eight times,
    Bristol six, Glasgow five, Southampton four, Portsmouth and Hull three and a minimum
    of one large raid on eight other cities. This was a result of a rapid escalation
    starting on 24 August 1940, when night bombers aiming for RAF airfields drifted
    off course and accidentally destroyed several London homes, killing civilians,
    combined with the UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill's retaliatory bombing of
    Berlin on the following night.[clarification needed]
  question: How many days did the aerial raids on Great Britain last?
- answer: mucus-secreting glands in the epidermis
  context: 'Annelids'' cuticles are made of collagen fibers, usually in layers that
    spiral in alternating directions so that the fibers cross each other. These are
    secreted by the one-cell deep epidermis (outermost skin layer). A few marine annelids
    that live in tubes lack cuticles, but their tubes have a similar structure, and
    mucus-secreting glands in the epidermis protect their skins. Under the epidermis
    is the dermis, which is made of connective tissue, in other words a combination
    of cells and non-cellular materials such as collagen. Below this are two layers
    of muscles, which develop from the lining of the coelom (body cavity): circular
    muscles make a segment longer and slimmer when they contract, while under them
    are longitudinal muscles, usually four distinct strips, whose contractions make
    the segment shorter and fatter. Some annelids also have oblique internal muscles
    that connect the underside of the body to each side.'
  question: What do non-cuticle annelids use to protect their skin?
- answer: Ellice Islands
  context: "Tuvalu (i/tu\u02D0\u02C8v\u0251\u02D0lu\u02D0/ too-VAH-loo or /\u02C8\
    tu\u02D0v\u0259lu\u02D0/ TOO-v\u0259-loo), formerly known as the Ellice Islands,\
    \ is a Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, midway between Hawaii\
    \ and Australia. It comprises three reef islands and six true atolls spread out\
    \ between the latitude of 5\xB0 to 10\xB0 south and longitude of 176\xB0 to 180\xB0\
    , west of the International Date Line. Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati, Nauru,\
    \ Samoa and Fiji. Tuvalu has a population of 10,640 (2012 census). The total land\
    \ area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi)."
  question: What is the previous name of Tuvalu?
- answer: Monophonic chant
  context: The Medieval period includes music from after the fall of Rome to about
    1400. Monophonic chant, also called plainsong or Gregorian chant, was the dominant
    form until about 1100. Polyphonic (multi-voiced) music developed from monophonic
    chant throughout the late Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, including the
    more complex voicings of motets.
  question: What can Plainsong or Gregorian chant also be called?
- answer: Third World revolutionary theory
  context: As a schoolboy, Gaddafi adopted the ideologies of Arab nationalism and
    Arab socialism, influenced in particular by Nasserism, the thought of Egyptian
    revolutionary and president Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom Gaddafi adopted as his hero.
    During the early 1970s, Gaddafi formulated his own particular approach to Arab
    nationalism and socialism, known as Third International Theory, which has been
    described as a combination of "utopian socialism, Arab nationalism, and the Third
    World revolutionary theory that was in vogue at the time". He laid out the principles
    of this Theory in the three volumes of The Green Book, in which he sought to "explain
    the structure of the ideal society." His Arab nationalist views led him to believe
    that there needed to be unity across the Arab world, combining the Arab nation
    under a single nation-state. He described his approach to economics as "Islamic
    socialism", although biographers Blundy and Lycett noted that Gaddafi's socialism
    had a "curiously Marxist undertone", with political scientist Sami Hajjar arguing
    that Gaddafi's model of socialism offered a simplification of Karl Marx and Friedrich
    Engels' theories. Gaddafi saw his socialist Jamahiriyah as a model for the Arab,
    Islamic, and non-aligned worlds to follow.
  question: What philosophy was combined with socialism and nationalism to form Third
    International Theory?
- answer: 535,000
  context: By 1900, 7,531 people lived in the city. The population increased gradually
    to 13,913 in 1910. At about this time, the U.S. Veterans Administration had begun
    construction on the present Veterans Hospital. Many veterans who had been gassed
    in World War I and were in need of respiratory therapy began coming to Tucson
    after the war, due to the clean dry air. Over the following years the city continued
    to grow, with the population increasing to 20,292 in 1920 and 36,818 in 1940.
    In 2006 the population of Pima County, in which Tucson is located, passed one
    million while the City of Tucson's population was 535,000.
  question: What was the population of Tuscon in 2006?
- answer: Greek Orthodox
  context: "The predominant religion is southern Europe is Christianity. Christianity\
    \ spread throughout Southern Europe during the Roman Empire, and Christianity\
    \ was adopted as the official religion of the Roman Empire in the year 380 AD.\
    \ Due to the historical break of the Christian Church into the western half based\
    \ in Rome and the eastern half based in Constantinople, different branches of\
    \ Christianity are prodominent in different parts of Europe. Christians in the\
    \ western half of Southern Europe \u2014 e.g., Portugal, Spain, Italy \u2014 are\
    \ generally Roman Catholic. Christians in the eastern half of Southern Europe\
    \ \u2014 e.g., Greece, Macedonia \u2014 are generally Greek Orthodox."
  question: Which denomination of Christianity is more common in the eastern part
    of Mediterranean Europe?
- answer: primarily on the West Coast and in western territories
  context: Chinese men entered the United States as laborers, primarily on the West
    Coast and in western territories. Following the Reconstruction era, as blacks
    set up independent farms, white planters imported Chinese laborers to satisfy
    their need for labor. In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed, and Chinese
    workers who chose to stay in the U.S. were unable to have their wives join them.
    In the South, some Chinese married into the black and mulatto communities, as
    generally discrimination meant they did not take white spouses. They rapidly left
    working as laborers, and set up groceries in small towns throughout the South.
    They worked to get their children educated and socially mobile.
  question: Where did most Chinese men enter the US?
- answer: '1914'
  context: Immigration of Czechs from Europe to the United States occurred primarily
    from 1848 to 1914. Czech is a Less Commonly Taught Language in U.S. schools, and
    is taught at Czech heritage centers. Large communities of Czech Americans live
    in the states of Texas, Nebraska and Wisconsin. In the 2000 United States Census,
    Czech was reported as the most-common language spoken at home (besides English)
    in Valley, Butler and Saunders Counties, Nebraska and Republic County, Kansas.
    With the exception of Spanish (the non-English language most commonly spoken at
    home nationwide), Czech was the most-common home language in over a dozen additional
    counties in Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, North Dakota and Minnesota. As of 2009, 70,500
    Americans spoke Czech as their first language (49th place nationwide, behind Turkish
    and ahead of Swedish).
  question: Czechs immigrated from Europe to the U.S. primary from 1848 to when?
- answer: Reynolds v. U.S., 98 U.S. 145
  context: Jefferson's concept of "separation of church and state" first became a
    part of Establishment Clause jurisprudence in Reynolds v. U.S., 98 U.S. 145 (1878).
    In that case, the court examined the history of religious liberty in the US, determining
    that while the constitution guarantees religious freedom, "The word 'religion'
    is not defined in the Constitution. We must go elsewhere, therefore, to ascertain
    its meaning, and nowhere more appropriately, we think, than to the history of
    the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted." The court found that
    the leaders in advocating and formulating the constitutional guarantee of religious
    liberty were James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. Quoting the "separation" paragraph
    from Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptists, the court concluded that, "coming
    as this does from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure, it may
    be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of
    the amendment thus secured."
  question: What case was Jefferson's concept apropos to?
- answer: the ring around the power button
  context: To aid customers with defective consoles, Microsoft extended the Xbox 360's
    manufacturer's warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate
    a "General Hardware Failure" error report. A "General Hardware Failure" is recognized
    on all models released before the Xbox 360 S by three quadrants of the ring around
    the power button flashing red. This error is often known as the "Red Ring of Death".
    In April 2009 the warranty was extended to also cover failures related to the
    E74 error code. The warranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures
    that do not generate these specific error codes.
  question: Where did users see the flashing light error codes display on their 360s?
- answer: 400,000
  context: World War II holds a special place in the American psyche as the country's
    greatest triumph, and the U.S. military personnel of World War II are frequently
    referred to as "the Greatest Generation." Over 16 million served (about 11% of
    the population), and over 400,000 died during the war. The U.S. emerged as one
    of the two undisputed superpowers along with the Soviet Union, and unlike the
    Soviet Union, the U.S. homeland was virtually untouched by the ravages of war.
    During and following World War II, the United States and Britain developed an
    increasingly strong defense and intelligence relationship. Manifestations of this
    include extensive basing of U.S. forces in the UK, shared intelligence, shared
    military technology (e.g. nuclear technology), and shared procurement.
  question: How many American service personnel died in World War II?
- answer: More than sixty
  context: "The 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many to be a golden age of\
    \ Greek cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important\
    \ historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: Irene Papas,\
    \ Melina Mercouri, Mihalis Kakogiannis, Alekos Sakellarios, Nikos Tsiforos, Iakovos\
    \ Kambanelis, Katina Paxinou, Nikos Koundouros, Ellie Lambeti, and others. More\
    \ than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements.\
    \ Notable films were \u0397 \u03BA\u03AC\u03BB\u03C0\u03B9\u03BA\u03B7 \u03BB\u03AF\

    \ by Kampanellis)."
  question: During the Greek cinema golden age, how many films were made each year?
- answer: Hirsch
  context: Hirsch held the opinion that Judaism demands an application of Torah thought
    to the entire realm of human experience, including the secular disciplines. His
    approach was termed the Torah im Derech Eretz approach, or "neo-Orthodoxy". While
    insisting on strict adherence to Jewish beliefs and practices, he held that Jews
    should attempt to engage and influence the modern world, and encouraged those
    secular studies compatible with Torah thought. This pattern of religious and secular
    involvement has been evident at many times in Jewish history. Scholars[who?] believe
    it was characteristic of the Jews in Babylon during the Amoraic and Geonic periods,
    and likewise in early medieval Spain, shown by their engagement with both Muslim
    and Christian society. It appeared as the traditional response to cultural and
    scientific innovation.
  question: Who held the opinion that judiasm demands and application of torah thought
    to the entire realm of human experience?
- answer: Muslim Brotherhood
  context: "Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein (Arabic: \u062C\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0639\u0628\

    \ in June 1956."
  question: What organization attempted to assassinate Nasser?
- answer: CPI
  context: 'Transparency International, an anti-corruption NGO, pioneered this field
    with the CPI, first released in 1995. This work is often credited with breaking
    a taboo and forcing the issue of corruption into high level development policy
    discourse. Transparency International currently publishes three measures, updated
    annually: a CPI (based on aggregating third-party polling of public perceptions
    of how corrupt different countries are); a Global Corruption Barometer (based
    on a survey of general public attitudes toward and experience of corruption);
    and a Bribe Payers Index, looking at the willingness of foreign firms to pay bribes.
    The Corruption Perceptions Index is the best known of these metrics, though it
    has drawn much criticism and may be declining in influence. In 2013 Transparency
    International published a report on the "Government Defence Anti-corruption Index".
    This index evaluates the risk of corruption in countries'' military sector.'
  question: What is the measure that it publishes that involves polling to determine
    the public's take on how corrupt various countries are?
- answer: Jackson Heights
  context: Stone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the
    construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire
    of 1835. A distinctive feature of many of the city's buildings is the wooden roof-mounted
    water towers. In the 1800s, the city required their installation on buildings
    higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures
    at lower elevations, which could break municipal water pipes. Garden apartments
    became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas, such as Jackson Heights.
  question: What area was known for its garden apartments?
- answer: Greek
  context: Carnival has been celebrated for centuries. The tradition was likely established
    under Venetian rule around the 16th century. It may have been influenced by Greek
    traditions, such as festivities for deities such as Dionysus. The celebration
    originally involved dressing in costumes and holding masked balls or visiting
    friends. In the twentieth century it became an organized event held during the
    10 days preceding Lent (according to the Greek Orthodox calendar). The festival
    is celebrated almost exclusively in the city of Limassol.
  question: Dionysus was a deity in whose tradition?
- answer: Wayne Rooney
  context: 'On 7 July 2004, in response to verbal attacks in Liverpool on Wayne Rooney,
    just before his transfer from Everton to Manchester United, who had sold his life
    story to The Sun, the paper devoted a full-page editorial to an apology for the
    "awful error" of its Hillsborough coverage and argued that Rooney (who was still
    only three years old at the time of Hillsborough) should not be punished for its
    "past sins". In January 2005, The Sun''s managing editor Graham Dudman admitting
    the Hillsborough coverage was "the worst mistake in our history", added: "What
    we did was a terrible mistake. It was a terrible, insensitive, horrible article,
    with a dreadful headline; but what we''d also say is: we have apologised for it,
    and the entire senior team here now is completely different from the team that
    put the paper out in 1989."'
  question: Which footballer was verbally attacked in Liverpool?
- answer: VBR
  context: 'A more sophisticated MP3 encoder can produce variable bitrate audio. MPEG
    audio may use bitrate switching on a per-frame basis, but only layer III decoders
    must support it. VBR is used when the goal is to achieve a fixed level of quality.
    The final file size of a VBR encoding is less predictable than with constant bitrate.
    Average bitrate is VBR implemented as a compromise between the two: the bitrate
    is allowed to vary for more consistent quality, but is controlled to remain near
    an average value chosen by the user, for predictable file sizes. Although an MP3
    decoder must support VBR to be standards compliant, historically some decoders
    have bugs with VBR decoding, particularly before VBR encoders became widespread.'
  question: What do encoders use when the goal is to achieve a fixed level of quality?
- answer: religious test
  context: The original charter of the Province of East Jersey had restricted membership
    in the Assembly to Christians; the Duke of York was fervently Catholic, and the
    proprietors of Perth Amboy, New Jersey were Scottish Catholic peers. The Province
    of West Jersey had declared, in 1681, that there should be no religious test for
    office. An oath had also been imposed on the militia during the French and Indian
    War requiring them to abjure the pretensions of the Pope, which may or may not
    have been applied during the Revolution. That law was replaced by 1799.
  question: What did the Province of West Jersey specify there would not be for those
    running for an office, in 1681?
- answer: Paul VI
  context: Paul VI did away with much of the regal splendor of the papacy. He was
    the last pope to date to be crowned; his successor Pope John Paul I replaced the
    Papal Coronation (which Paul had already substantially modified, but which he
    left mandatory in his 1975 apostolic constitution Romano Pontifici Eligendo) with
    a Papal Inauguration. Paul VI donated his own Papal Tiara, a gift from his former
    Archdiocese of Milan, to the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate
    Conception in Washington, DC (where it is on permanent display in the Crypt) as
    a gift to American Catholics.
  question: Who was the last pope to be crowned?
- answer: a definition
  context: The Necessary exists 'due-to-Its-Self', and has no quiddity/essence (mahiyya)
    other than existence (wujud). Furthermore, It is 'One' (wahid ahad) since there
    cannot be more than one 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' without differentia
    (fasl) to distinguish them from each other. Yet, to require differentia entails
    that they exist 'due-to-themselves' as well as 'due to what is other than themselves';
    and this is contradictory. However, if no differentia distinguishes them from
    each other, then there is no sense in which these 'Existents' are not one and
    the same. Avicenna adds that the 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' has no genus
    (jins), nor a definition (hadd), nor a counterpart (nadd), nor an opposite (did),
    and is detached (bari) from matter (madda), quality (kayf), quantity (kam), place
    (ayn), situation (wad), and time (waqt).
  question: What is something that the necessary does not have?
- answer: Jean-Jacques Rousseau
  context: In the 18th and 19th century, green was associated with the romantic movement
    in literature and art. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau celebrated
    the virtues of nature, The German poet and philosopher Goethe declared that green
    was the most restful color, suitable for decorating bedrooms. Painters such as
    John Constable and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot depicted the lush green of rural
    landscapes and forests. Green was contrasted to the smoky grays and blacks of
    the Industrial Revolution.
  question: Who was a French philospher that celebrated the virtues of nature?
- answer: "Gregorio Mara\xF1\xF3n"
  context: "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish\
    \ physician, Gregorio Mara\xF1\xF3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and\
    \ subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\xF1\xF3n found that\
    \ most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking\
    \ stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal\
    \ as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions\
    \ played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed\
    \ to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given\
    \ physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the\
    \ subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process:\
    \ general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological\
    \ arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of\
    \ a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the\
    \ pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding\
    \ heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer,\
    \ Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions\
    \ despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of\
    \ epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending\
    \ on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion.\
    \ Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the\
    \ participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response.\
    \ This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) Gut Reactions."
  question: Whose work did the theory of Stanley Schachter build on?
- answer: Mal'ta-Buret'
  context: A 2013 study in Nature reported that DNA found in the 24,000-year-old remains
    of a young boy from the archaeological Mal'ta-Buret' culture suggest that up to
    one-third of the indigenous Americans may have ancestry that can be traced back
    to western Eurasians, who may have "had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000
    years ago than commonly thought". "We estimate that 14 to 38 percent of Native
    American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population,"
    the authors wrote. Professor Kelly Graf said,
  question: What culture was the boy from?
- answer: not guilty by reason of insanity
  context: "On 2 March 1882, Roderick Maclean, a disgruntled poet apparently offended\
    \ by Victoria's refusal to accept one of his poems, shot at the Queen as her carriage\
    \ left Windsor railway station. Two schoolboys from Eton College struck him with\
    \ their umbrellas, until he was hustled away by a policeman. Victoria was outraged\
    \ when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity, but was so pleased by the\
    \ many expressions of loyalty after the attack that she said it was \"worth being\
    \ shot at\u2014to see how much one is loved\"."
  question: What was the verdict in Maclean's trial?
- answer: church council
  context: Canon law is the body of laws and regulations made by ecclesiastical authority
    (Church leadership), for the government of a Christian organization or church
    and its members. It is the internal ecclesiastical law governing the Catholic
    Church (both Latin Church and Eastern Catholic Churches), the Eastern and Oriental
    Orthodox churches, and the individual national churches within the Anglican Communion.
    The way that such church law is legislated, interpreted and at times adjudicated
    varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a
    canon was originally a rule adopted by a church council; these canons formed the
    foundation of canon law.
  question: What body was first responsible for creating canon?
- answer: "Trocad\xE9ro"
  context: "Several hundred pro-Tibet protesters gathered at the Trocad\xE9ro with\
    \ banners and Tibetan flags, and remained there for a peaceful protest, never\
    \ approaching the torch relay itself. Among them was Jane Birkin, who spoke to\
    \ the media about the \"lack of freedom of speech\" in China. Also present was\
    \ Thupten Gyatso, President of the French Tibetan community, who called upon pro-Tibet\
    \ demonstrators to \"remain calm, non-violent, peaceful\"."
  question: Where did pro-Tibetan protesters get together?
- answer: complicated
  context: But in statistical mechanics things get more complicated. On one hand,
    statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics, in that thermodynamic
    behavior, such as glass breaking, can be explained by the fundamental laws of
    physics paired with a statistical postulate. But statistical mechanics, unlike
    classical thermodynamics, is time-reversal symmetric. The second law of thermodynamics,
    as it arises in statistical mechanics, merely states that it is overwhelmingly
    likely that net entropy will increase, but it is not an absolute law.
  question: How are things in statistical mechanics?
- answer: Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan
  context: In the 20th century, as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan had all been
    occupied by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the capital of the
    Republic of China had been temporary relocated to Chongqing, then a major city
    in Sichuan. An enduring legacy of this move is that nearby inland provinces, such
    as Shaanxi, Gansu, and Guizhou, which previously never had modern Western-style
    universities, began to be developed in this regard. The difficulty of accessing
    the region overland from the eastern part of China and the foggy climate hindering
    the accuracy of Japanese bombing of the Sichuan Basin, made the region the stronghold
    of Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang government during 1938-45, and led to the Bombing
    of Chongqing.
  question: What are some major cities occupied by the Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese
    War?
- answer: Maslenitsa
  context: The term Carnival is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic
    presence. However, the Philippines, a predominantly Roman Catholic country, does
    not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after
    1939, the last carnival in the country. In historically Lutheran countries, the
    celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans
    and Methodists, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur
    on Shrove Tuesday. In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during
    the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands,
    the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). This dates
    back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of
    St. Martin's Day.
  question: What is the name of the festival celebrated in Eastern Orthodox nations
    during the last week before Great Lent?
- answer: profound
  context: 'The Spanish Empire and other Europeans brought horses to the Americas.
    Some of these animals escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in
    the wild. The re-introduction of the horse, extinct in the Americas for over 7500
    years, had a profound impact on Native American culture in the Great Plains of
    North America and of Patagonia in South America. By domesticating horses, some
    tribes had great success: horses enabled them to expand their territories, exchange
    more goods with neighboring tribes, and more easily capture game, especially bison.'
  question: What kind of impact did the re-emergence of horses have on some Native
    American cultures?
- answer: to reform the Church in line with Calvinist doctrines
  context: "John Knox (1505\u20131572), a Scot who had spent time studying under Calvin\
    \ in Geneva, returned to Scotland and urged his countrymen to reform the Church\
    \ in line with Calvinist doctrines. After a period of religious convulsion and\
    \ political conflict culminating in a victory for the Protestant party at the\
    \ Siege of Leith the authority of the Church of Rome was abolished in favour of\
    \ Reformation by the legislation of the Scottish Reformation Parliament in 1560.\
    \ The Church was eventually organised by Andrew Melville along Presbyterian lines\
    \ to become the national Church of Scotland. King James VI and I moved the Church\
    \ of Scotland towards an episcopal form of government, and in 1637, James' successor,\
    \ Charles I and William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, attempted to force\
    \ the Church of Scotland to use the Book of Common Prayer. What resulted was an\
    \ armed insurrection, with many Scots signing the Solemn League and Covenant.\
    \ The Covenanters would serve as the government of Scotland for nearly a decade,\
    \ and would also send military support to the Parliamentarians during the English\
    \ Civil War. Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II, despite\
    \ the initial support that he received from the Covenanters, reinstated an episcopal\
    \ form of government on the church."
  question: What did John Knox do when he returned to Scotland after studying under
    Calvin?
- answer: '120'
  context: The initial assault by North Korean KPA forces were aided by the use of
    Soviet T-34-85 tanks. A North Korean tank corps equipped with about 120 T-34s
    spearheaded the invasion. These drove against a ROK Army with few anti-tank weapons
    adequate to deal with the Soviet T-34s. Additional Soviet armor was added as the
    offensive progressed. The North Korean tanks had a good deal of early successes
    against South Korean infantry, elements of the 24th Infantry Division, and those
    United States built M24 Chaffee light tanks that they encountered. Interdiction
    by ground attack aircraft was the only means of slowing the advancing Korean armor.
    The tide turned in favour of the United Nations forces in August 1950 when the
    North Koreans suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the
    UN forces brought heavier equipment to bear, including M4A3 Sherman medium tanks
    backed by U.S. M26 heavy tanks, along with the British Centurion, Churchill, and
    Cromwell tanks.
  question: How many tanks were in the North Korean tank corps?
- answer: '2008'
  context: In March 2011, it was said on the Wayback Machine forum that "The Beta
    of the new Wayback Machine has a more complete and up-to-date index of all crawled
    materials into 2010, and will continue to be updated regularly. The index driving
    the classic Wayback Machine only has a little bit of material past 2008, and no
    further index updates are planned, as it will be phased out this year".
  question: The older version of Wayback Machine did not have much new data past what
    year?
- answer: Popularization
  context: One of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought
    to the discipline of science was its popularization. An increasingly literate
    population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove
    the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. The
    new literate population was due to a high rise in the availability of food. This
    enabled many people to rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food,
    they had money for education. Popularization was generally part of an overarching
    Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured "to make information available to the greatest
    number of people." As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th
    century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up
    new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery
    of universities and academies. More formal works included explanations of scientific
    theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the
    original scientific text. Sir Isaac Newton's celebrated Philosophiae Naturalis
    Principia Mathematica was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers
    without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate
    and analyze the text in the vernacular.
  question: Which ideal endeavoured to make information available to the greatest
    number of people?
- answer: Charophycean green algae
  context: Fossilized spores suggest that higher plants (embryophytes) have lived
    on land for at least 475 million years. Early land plants reproduced sexually
    with flagellated, swimming sperm, like the green algae from which they evolved.
    An adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of upright meiosporangia
    for dispersal by spores to new habitats. This feature is lacking in the descendants
    of their nearest algal relatives, the Charophycean green algae. A later terrestrial
    adaptation took place with retention of the delicate, avascular sexual stage,
    the gametophyte, within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte. This occurred
    by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release, as in non-seed
    plants. A current example of how this might have happened can be seen in the precocious
    spore germination in Selaginella, the spike-moss. The result for the ancestors
    of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case, the seed. The first seed bearing
    plants, like the ginkgo, and conifers (such as pines and firs), did not produce
    flowers. The pollen grains (males) of Ginkgo and cycads produce a pair of flagellated,
    mobile sperm cells that "swim" down the developing pollen tube to the female and
    her eggs.
  question: What are the nearest algal relatives existing today?
- answer: Donald Tsang
  context: 'Hong Kong: The event was held in Hong Kong on May 2. In the ceremony held
    at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, Chief Executive Donald Tsang
    handed the torch to the first torchbearer, Olympic medalist Lee Lai Shan. The
    torch relay then traveled through Nathan Road, Lantau Link, Sha Tin (crossed Shing
    Mun River via a dragon boat, which had been never used before in the history of
    Olympic torch relays), Victoria Harbour (crossed by Tin Hau, a VIP vessel managed
    by the Marine Department) before ending in Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai.
    A total of 120 torchbearers were selected to participate in the event consisting
    of celebrities, athletes and pro-Beijing camp politicians. No politicians from
    the pro-democracy camp were selected as torchbearers. One torchbearer could not
    participate due to flight delay. It was estimated that more than 200,000 spectators
    came out and watched the relay. Many enthusiastic supporters wore red shirts and
    waved large Chinese flags. According to Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration
    Henry Tang, 3,000 police were deployed to ensure order.'
  question: Who handed the torch to Lee Lai Shan, the first torchbearer?
- answer: marketing
  context: The system's launch represented not only a new product, but also a reframing
    of the severely damaged home video game market segment as a whole. The video game
    market crash of 1983 had occurred in significant part due to a lack of consumer
    and retailer confidence in video games, which had in turn been due partially to
    confusion and misrepresentation in the marketing of video games. Prior to the
    NES, the packaging of many video games presented bombastic artwork which exaggerated
    the graphics of the actual game. In terms of product identity, a single game such
    as Pac-Man would appear in many versions on many different game consoles and computers,
    with large variations in graphics, sound, and general quality between the versions.
    By stark contrast, Nintendo's marketing strategy aimed to regain consumer and
    retailer confidence, by delivering a singular platform whose technology was not
    in need of heavy exaggeration and whose qualities were clearly defined.
  question: The crash was caused in part by the confusion and misrepresentation of
    what in video games?
- answer: Harvard Mark I computer
  context: In most computers, individual instructions are stored as machine code with
    each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or opcode for
    short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command
    to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest computers
    are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex
    computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code.
    Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction
    codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists
    of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves
    be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental
    concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate
    on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program[citation needed], architecture.
    In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that
    is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the Harvard architecture
    after the Harvard Mark I computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits
    of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in CPU caches.
  question: Which computer is the Harvard architecture modeled after?
- answer: effective yet consistent research
  context: Bioscience is the overall major in which undergraduate students who are
    interested in general well-being take in college. Immunology is a branch of bioscience
    for undergraduate programs but the major gets specified as students move on for
    graduate program in immunology. The aim of immunology is to study the health of
    humans and animals through effective yet consistent research, (AAAAI, 2013). The
    most important thing about being immunologists is the research because it is the
    biggest portion of their jobs.
  question: What two conditions apply to good immunological study?
- answer: Rice
  context: Rice is a staple in the diet of residents near the coast and millet a staple
    in the interior. Fish, shellfish, fruits and vegetables are commonly eaten along
    with cereal grains, milk, curd and whey. The Portuguese encouraged peanut production.
    Vigna subterranea (Bambara groundnut) and Macrotyloma geocarpum (Hausa groundnut)
    are also grown. Black-eyed peas are also part of the diet. Palm oil is harvested.
  question: What grain is a staple for residents near the coast of Guinea-Bissau?
- answer: an assembly of free tribesmen
  context: Concerning the early Polish tribes, geography contributed to long-standing
    traditions. The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying
    religious cult, governed by the wiec, an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when
    safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern.
    The election privilege was usually limited to elites.
  question: What was the wiec?
- answer: third
  context: Bush and Kerry met for the third and final debate at Arizona State University
    on October 13. 51 million viewers watched the debate which was moderated by Bob
    Schieffer of CBS News. However, at the time of the ASU debate, there were 15.2
    million viewers tuned in to watch the Major League Baseball playoffs broadcast
    simultaneously. After Kerry, responding to a question about gay rights, reminded
    the audience that Vice President Cheney's daughter was a lesbian, Cheney responded
    with a statement calling himself "a pretty angry father" due to Kerry using Cheney's
    daughter's sexual orientation for his political purposes.
  question: How many debates were there in total, between Kerry and Bush?
- answer: Nasserites
  context: "By 1957, pan-Arabism was the dominant ideology of the Arab world, and\
    \ the average Arab citizen considered Nasser his undisputed leader. Historian\
    \ Adeed Dawisha credited Nasser's status to his \"charisma, bolstered by his perceived\
    \ victory in the Suez Crisis\". The Cairo-based Voice of the Arabs radio station\
    \ spread Nasser's ideas of united Arab action throughout the Arabic-speaking world\
    \ and historian Eugene Rogan wrote, \"Nasser conquered the Arab world by radio.\"\
    \ Lebanese sympathizers of Nasser and the Egyptian embassy in Beirut\u2014the\
    \ press center of the Arab world\u2014bought out Lebanese media outlets to further\
    \ disseminate Nasser's ideals. Nasser also enjoyed the support of Arab nationalist\
    \ organizations, both civilian and paramilitary, throughout the region. His followers\
    \ were numerous and well-funded, but lacked any permanent structure and organization.\
    \ They called themselves \"Nasserites\", despite Nasser's objection to the label\
    \ (he preferred the term \"Arab nationalists\")."
  question: What were Arab admirers of Nasser called?
- answer: Northern Catalonia and Minorca
  context: Following the French capture of Algeria (1833), that region saw several
    waves of Catalan-speaking settlers. People from the Spanish Alacant province settled
    around Oran, whereas Algiers received immigration from Northern Catalonia and
    Minorca. Their speech was known as patuet. By 1911, the number of Catalan speakers
    was around 100,000. After the declaration of independence of Algeria in 1962,
    almost all the Catalan speakers fled to Northern Catalonia (as Pieds-Noirs) or
    Alacant.
  question: Where did the Algiers immigrants come from?
- answer: parliamentary
  context: "Israel operates under a parliamentary system as a democratic republic\
    \ with universal suffrage. A member of parliament supported by a parliamentary\
    \ majority becomes the prime minister\u2014usually this is the chair of the largest\
    \ party. The prime minister is the head of government and head of the cabinet.\
    \ Israel is governed by a 120-member parliament, known as the Knesset. Membership\
    \ of the Knesset is based on proportional representation of political parties,\
    \ with a 3.25% electoral threshold, which in practice has resulted in coalition\
    \ governments."
  question: Israel operates under what kind of system?
- answer: So Help Me God
  context: "Having initially announced a new album entitled So Help Me God slated\
    \ for a 2014 release, in March 2015 West announced that the album would instead\
    \ be tentatively called SWISH. Later that month, West was awarded an honorary\
    \ doctorate by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for his contributions\
    \ to music, fashion, and popular culture, officially making him an honorary DFA.\
    \ The next month, West headlined at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK, despite\
    \ a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance. At one point,\
    \ he told the audience: \"You are now watching the greatest living rock star on\
    \ the planet.\" Media outlets, including social media sites such as Twitter, were\
    \ sharply divided on his performance. NME stated, \"The decision to book West\
    \ for the slot has proved controversial since its announcement, and the show itself\
    \ appeared to polarise both Glastonbury goers and those who tuned in to watch\
    \ on their TVs.\" The publication added that \"he's letting his music speak for\
    \ and prove itself.\" The Guardian said that \"his set has a potent ferocity \u2013\
    \ but there are gaps and stutters, and he cuts a strangely lone figure in front\
    \ of the vast crowd.\""
  question: What was the original name of Kanye's album "SWISH"?
- answer: yeast
  context: "Most beers are cleared of yeast by filtering when packaged in bottles\
    \ and cans. However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast\u2014either by\
    \ being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It\
    \ is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment\
    \ at the bottom of the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast;\
    \ this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen\
    \ wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to\
    \ suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle\
    \ may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned\
    \ beers."
  question: What do bottle conditioned beers contain that most fears do not?
- answer: active
  context: 'The official published membership statistics, such as those mentioned
    above, include only those who submit reports for their personal ministry; official
    statistics do not include inactive and disfellowshipped individuals or others
    who might attend their meetings. As a result, only about half of those who self-identified
    as Jehovah''s Witnesses in independent demographic studies are considered active
    by the faith itself. The 2008 US Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life survey found
    a low retention rate among members of the religion: about 37% of people raised
    in the religion continued to identify themselves as Jehovah''s Witnesses.'
  question: Only about half all Jehovah's Witnesses are actually considered what in
    the faith itself?
- answer: Myanmar improved yet again, receiving a score of five in civil liberties
    and a six in political freedom
  context: According to the Crisis Group, since Myanmar transitioned to a new government
    in August 2011, the country's human rights record has been improving. Previously
    giving Myanmar its lowest rating of 7, the 2012 Freedom in the World report also
    notes improvement, giving Myanmar a 6 for improvements in civil liberties and
    political rights, the release of political prisoners, and a loosening of restrictions.
    In 2013, Myanmar improved yet again, receiving a score of five in civil liberties
    and a six in political freedoms
  question: What is the current rating of for Burma from the  Freedom in the World
    report and what caused the current standing ?
- answer: March
  context: Oklahoma City has a very active severe weather season from March through
    June, especially during April and May. Being in the center of what is colloquially
    referred to as Tornado Alley, it is prone to especially frequent and severe tornadoes,
    as well as very severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes. Tornadoes have occurred
    in every month of the year and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn,
    especially October. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone
    major cities in the world, with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits
    since 1890. Since the time weather records have been kept, Oklahoma City has been
    struck by thirteen violent tornadoes, eleven F/EF4s and two F/EF5. On May 3, 1999
    parts of southern Oklahoma City and nearby suburban communities suffered from
    one of the most powerful tornadoes on record, an F5 on the Fujita scale, with
    wind speeds estimated by radar at 318 mph (510 km/h). On May 20, 2013, far southwest
    Oklahoma City, along with Newcastle and Moore, was hit again by a EF5 tornado;
    it was 0.5 to 1.3 miles (0.80 to 2.09 km) wide and killed 23 people. Less than
    two weeks later, on May 31, another outbreak affected the Oklahoma City area,
    including an EF1 and an EF0 within the city and a tornado several miles west of
    the city that was 2.6 miles (4.2 km) in width, the widest tornado ever recorded.
  question: When is Oklahoma city sever weather season begin?
- answer: Theatre Tulsa
  context: Prominent theatre companies in Oklahoma include, in the capital city, Oklahoma
    City Theatre Company, Carpenter Square Theatre, Oklahoma Shakespeare in the Park,
    and CityRep. CityRep is a professional company affording equity points to those
    performers and technical theatre professionals. In Tulsa, Oklahoma's oldest resident
    professional company is American Theatre Company, and Theatre Tulsa is the oldest
    community theatre company west of the Mississippi. Other companies in Tulsa include
    Heller Theatre and Tulsa Spotlight Theater. The cities of Norman, Lawton, and
    Stillwater, among others, also host well-reviewed community theatre companies.
  question: What is the oldest community theater group west of the Mississippi River?
- answer: MEX
  context: "Mexico City is served by Mexico City International Airport (IATA Airport\
    \ Code: MEX). This airport is Latin America's second busiest and one of the largests\
    \ in traffic, with daily flights to United States and Canada, mainland Mexico,\
    \ Central America and the Caribbean, South America, Europe and Asia. Aerom\xE9\
    xico (Skyteam) is based at this airport, and provide codeshare agreements with\
    \ non-Mexican airlines that span the entire globe. In 2014, the airport handled\
    \ well over 34 million passengers, just over 2 million more than the year before.\
    \ This traffic exceeds the current capacity of the airport, which has historically\
    \ centralized the majority of air traffic in the country. An alternate option\
    \ is Lic. Adolfo L\xF3pez Mateos International Airport (IATA Airport Code: TLC)\
    \ in nearby Toluca, State of Mexico, although due to several airlines' decisions\
    \ to terminate service to TLC, the airport has seen a passenger drop to just over\
    \ 700,000 passengers in 2014 from over 2.1 million passengers just four years\
    \ prior."
  question: What is the short hand code for Mexico City's largest airport?
- answer: Upper Street
  context: Islington's 1 mile (1.6 km) long Upper Street, extending northwards from
    Angel, has more bars and restaurants than any other street in the United Kingdom.
    Europe's busiest shopping area is Oxford Street, a shopping street nearly 1 mile
    (1.6 km) long, making it the longest shopping street in the United Kingdom. Oxford
    Street is home to vast numbers of retailers and department stores, including the
    world-famous Selfridges flagship store. Knightsbridge, home to the equally renowned
    Harrods department store, lies to the south-west.
  question: What street in Islington boasts more bars and restaurants than any other
    street in Britain?
- answer: migratory restlessness
  context: 'The primary physiological cue for migration are the changes in the day
    length. These changes are also related to hormonal changes in the birds. In the
    period before migration, many birds display higher activity or Zugunruhe (German:
    migratory restlessness), first described by Johann Friedrich Naumann in 1795,
    as well as physiological changes such as increased fat deposition. The occurrence
    of Zugunruhe even in cage-raised birds with no environmental cues (e.g. shortening
    of day and falling temperature) has pointed to the role of circannual endogenous
    programs in controlling bird migrations. Caged birds display a preferential flight
    direction that corresponds with the migratory direction they would take in nature,
    changing their preferential direction at roughly the same time their wild conspecifics
    change course.'
  question: What does Zugunruhe mean in English?
- answer: the western part of Todmorden
  context: Lancashire is smaller than its historical extent following a major reform
    of local government. In 1889, the administrative county of Lancashire was created,
    covering the historical county except for the county boroughs such as Blackburn,
    Burnley, Barrow-in-Furness, Preston, Wigan, Liverpool and Manchester. The area
    served by the Lord-Lieutenant (termed now a ceremonial county) covered the entirety
    of the administrative county and the county boroughs, and was expanded whenever
    boroughs annexed areas in neighbouring counties such as Wythenshawe in Manchester
    south of the River Mersey and historically in Cheshire, and southern Warrington.
    It did not cover the western part of Todmorden, where the ancient border between
    Lancashire and Yorkshire passes through the middle of the town.
  question: Where is the ancient border between Lancashire and Yorkshire located?
- answer: Technicolor
  context: An exception is the United States, where patents filed prior to 8 June
    1995 expire 17 years after the publication date of the patent, but application
    extensions make it possible for a patent to issue much later than normally expected
    (see submarine patents). The various MP3-related patents expire on dates ranging
    from 2007 to 2017 in the U.S. Patents filed for anything disclosed in ISO CD 11172
    a year or more after its publication are questionable. If only the known MP3 patents
    filed by December 1992 are considered, then MP3 decoding has been patent-free
    in the US since 22 September 2015 when U.S. Patent 5,812,672 expired which had
    a PCT filing in October 1992. If the longest-running patent mentioned in the aforementioned
    references is taken as a measure, then the MP3 technology will be patent-free
    in the United States on 30 December 2017 when U.S. Patent 5,703,999, held by the
    Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft and administered by Technicolor, expires.
  question: Who administered the longest running MP3 patent in the United States?
- answer: $5
  context: Nintendo was accused of antitrust behavior because of the strict licensing
    requirements. The United States Department of Justice and several states began
    probing Nintendo's business practices, leading to the involvement of Congress
    and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC conducted an extensive investigation
    which included interviewing hundreds of retailers. During the FTC probe, Nintendo
    changed the terms of its publisher licensing agreements to eliminate the two-year
    rule and other restrictive terms. Nintendo and the FTC settled the case in April
    1991, with Nintendo required to send vouchers giving a $5 discount off to a new
    game, to every person that had purchased a NES title between June 1988 and December
    1990. GameSpy remarked that Nintendo's punishment was particularly weak giving
    the case's findings, although it has been speculated that the FTC did not want
    to damage the video game industry in the United States.
  question: How much were the vouchers worth that Nintendo sent out?
- answer: First Aliyah
  context: The first wave of modern Jewish migration to Ottoman-ruled Palestine, known
    as the First Aliyah, began in 1881, as Jews fled pogroms in Eastern Europe. Although
    the Zionist movement already existed in practice, Austro-Hungarian journalist
    Theodor Herzl is credited with founding political Zionism, a movement which sought
    to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel, thus offering a solution to
    the so-called Jewish Question of the European states, in conformity with the goals
    and achievements of other national projects of the time. In 1896, Herzl published
    Der Judenstaat (The State of the Jews), offering his vision of a future Jewish
    state; the following year he presided over the first Zionist Congress.
  question: What was the first wave of modern Jewish migration to Ottoman-ruled Palestine
    known as?
- answer: '17.38'
  context: According to Eurostat, Greece's largest port by tons of goods transported
    in 2010 is the port of Aghioi Theodoroi, with 17.38 million tons. The Port of
    Thessaloniki comes second with 15.8 million tons, followed by the Port of Piraeus,
    with 13.2 million tons, and the port of Eleusis, with 12.37 million tons. The
    total number of goods transported through Greece in 2010 amounted to 124.38 million
    tons, a considerable drop from the 164.3 million tons transported through the
    country in 2007. Since then, Piraeus has grown to become the Mediterranean's third-largest
    port thanks to heavy investment by Chinese logistics giant COSCO. In 2013, Piraeus
    was declared the fastest-growing port in the world.
  question: How many million of tons went through Aghioi Theodoroi in 2010?
- answer: decreased economic efficiency
  context: Changing clocks and DST rules has a direct economic cost, entailing extra
    work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example,
    a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500 million to $1 billion,
    and Utah State University economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost
    opportunity cost at around $1.7 billion USD. Although it has been argued that
    clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the
    daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31 billion on US
    stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The results
    have been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by
    disputers.
  question: What have some people argued correlates with time shifts from daylight
    savings?
- answer: Glastonbury Festival
  context: "In 2011, documents obtained by WikiLeaks revealed that Beyonc\xE9 was\
    \ one of many entertainers who performed for the family of Libyan ruler Muammar\
    \ Gaddafi. Rolling Stone reported that the music industry was urging them to return\
    \ the money they earned for the concerts; a spokesperson for Beyonc\xE9 later\
    \ confirmed to The Huffington Post that she donated the money to the Clinton Bush\
    \ Haiti Fund. Later that year she became the first solo female artist to headline\
    \ the main Pyramid stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival in over twenty years,\
    \ and was named the highest-paid performer in the world per minute."
  question: Where did Beyonce perform in 2011?
- answer: Pindus mountain range
  context: The climate of Greece is primarily Mediterranean, featuring mild, wet winters
    and hot, dry summers. This climate occurs at all coastal locations, including
    Athens, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, Crete, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands
    and parts of the Central Continental Greece region. The Pindus mountain range
    strongly affects the climate of the country, as areas to the west of the range
    are considerably wetter on average (due to greater exposure to south-westerly
    systems bringing in moisture) than the areas lying to the east of the range (due
    to a rain shadow effect).
  question: Greece's climate is affected by what range?
- answer: statistical update
  context: A new index was released on December 18, 2008. This so-called "statistical
    update" covered the period up to 2006 and was published without an accompanying
    Human Development Report. The update is relevant due to newly released estimates
    of purchasing power parities (PPP), implying substantial adjustments for many
    countries, resulting in changes in HDI values and, in many cases, HDI ranks.
  question: What type of update was released on December 18, 2008?
- answer: a priori notion
  context: "In 1781, Immanuel Kant published the Critique of Pure Reason, one of the\
    \ most influential works in the history of the philosophy of space and time. He\
    \ describes time as an a priori notion that, together with other a priori notions\
    \ such as space, allows us to comprehend sense experience. Kant denies that either\
    \ space or time are substance, entities in themselves, or learned by experience;\
    \ he holds, rather, that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to\
    \ structure our experience. Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far\
    \ apart objects are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare\
    \ the interval between (or duration of) events. Although space and time are held\
    \ to be transcendentally ideal in this sense, they are also empirically real\u2014\
    that is, not mere illusions."
  question: What did Kant describe time as?
- answer: the contiguous United States
  context: "Indigenous peoples in what is now the contiguous United States, including\
    \ their descendants, are commonly called \"American Indians\", or simply \"Indians\"\
    \ domestically, or \"Native Americans\" by the USCB. In Alaska, indigenous peoples\
    \ belong to 11 cultures with 11 languages. These include the St. Lawrence Island\
    \ Yupik, I\xF1upiat, Athabaskan, Yup'ik, Cup'ik, Unangax, Alutiiq, Eyak, Haida,\
    \ Tsimshian, and Tlingit, who are collectively called Alaska Natives. Indigenous\
    \ Polynesian peoples, which include Marshallese, Samoan, Tahitian, and Tongan,\
    \ are politically considered Pacific Islands American but are geographically and\
    \ culturally distinct from indigenous peoples of the Americas."
  question: Where are the indigenous peoples referred to as "American Indians"?
- answer: Bar-headed geese Anser indicus
  context: Birds fly at varying altitudes during migration. An expedition to Mt. Everest
    found skeletons of northern pintail Anas acuta and black-tailed godwit Limosa
    limosa at 5,000 m (16,000 ft) on the Khumbu Glacier. Bar-headed geese Anser indicus
    have been recorded by GPS flying at up to 6,540 metres (21,460 ft) while crossing
    the Himalayas, at the same time engaging in the highest rates of climb to altitude
    for any bird. Anecdotal reports of them flying much higher have yet to be corroborated
    with any direct evidence. Seabirds fly low over water but gain altitude when crossing
    land, and the reverse pattern is seen in landbirds. However most bird migration
    is in the range of 150 to 600 m (490 to 1,970 ft). Bird strike aviation records
    from the United States show most collisions occur below 600 m (2,000 ft) and almost
    none above 1,800 m (5,900 ft).
  question: Which birds have the highest rates of climb to altitude?
- answer: The Office of the Federal Register
  context: The Office of the Federal Register publishes the Federal Register, Code
    of Federal Regulations, and United States Statutes at Large, among others. It
    also administers the Electoral College.
  question: Which office publishes the United States Statutes at Large?
- answer: the people's
  context: 'Gorbachev also radically expanded the scope of Glasnost, stating that
    no subject was off-limits for open discussion in the media. Even so, the cautious
    Soviet intelligentsia took almost a year to begin pushing the boundaries to see
    if he meant what he said. For the first time, the Communist Party leader had appealed
    over the heads of Central Committee members for the people''s support in exchange
    for expansion of liberties. The tactic proved successful: Within two years political
    reform could no longer be sidetracked by Party "conservatives." An unintended
    consequence was that having saved reform, Gorbachev''s move ultimately killed
    the very system it was designed to save.'
  question: Whose support did Gorbachev seek in order to increase liberties?
- answer: "Charles Hall\xE9"
  context: "From 1842 onwards, Chopin showed signs of serious illness. After a solo\
    \ recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzyma\u0142a: \"I have to\
    \ lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much.\" He was forced\
    \ by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat\
    \ performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Erard's on 1 March\
    \ 1843. Late in 1844, Charles Hall\xE9 visited Chopin and found him \"hardly able\
    \ to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain\", although\
    \ his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor. Chopin's\
    \ health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern\
    \ research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered\
    \ from temporal lobe epilepsy."
  question: Who visited Chopin in 1844 and wrote about his inability to move?
- answer: 15 May 1947
  context: On 15 May 1947, the General Assembly of the newly formed United Nations
    resolved that a committee, United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP),
    be created "to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the Assembly
    a report on the question of Palestine". In the Report of the Committee dated 3
    September 1947 to the UN General Assembly, the majority of the Committee in Chapter
    VI proposed a plan to replace the British Mandate with "an independent Arab State,
    an independent Jewish State, and the City of Jerusalem ... the last to be under
    an International Trusteeship System". On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly
    adopted a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of the Plan
    of Partition with Economic Union as Resolution 181 (II). The Plan attached to
    the resolution was essentially that proposed by the majority of the Committee
    in the Report of 3 September 1947.
  question: When was the UNSCOP formed?
- answer: Panthalassa
  context: "The Silurian is a major division of the geologic timescale that started\
    \ about 443.8 \xB1 1.5 Ma. During the Silurian, Gondwana continued a slow southward\
    \ drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian ice\
    \ caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting\
    \ of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels, recognizable from\
    \ the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming\
    \ an unconformity. Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near\
    \ the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica.\
    \ The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other\
    \ minor oceans include Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, Rheic Ocean, a seaway of Iapetus\
    \ Ocean (now in between Avalonia and Laurentia), and newly formed Ural Ocean."
  question: Which ocean ranged the majority of the northern hemisphere in the Silurian
    period?
- answer: sea lions
  context: '"Azure, three ships with three masts, rigged and under full sail, the
    sails, pennants and ensigns Argent, each charged with a cross Gules; on a chief
    of the second a pale quarterly Azure and Gules, on the 1st and 4th a fleur-de-lis
    or, on the 2nd and 3rd a leopard or, between two roses Gules seeded Or barbed
    Vert." The shield had as a crest: "A sphere without a frame, bounded with the
    Zodiac in bend Or, between two pennants flottant Argent, each charged with a cross
    Gules, over the sphere the words DEUS INDICAT" (Latin: God Indicates). The supporters
    were two sea lions (lions with fishes'' tails) and the motto was DEO DUCENTE NIL
    NOCET (Latin: Where God Leads, Nothing Hurts).'
  question: after the DEUS INDICAT what type of sea animals were pictured?
- answer: With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between
    donors and recipients are stark
  context: Police development-aid to weak, failed or failing states is another form
    of transnational policing that has garnered attention. This form of transnational
    policing plays an increasingly important role in United Nations peacekeeping and
    this looks set to grow in the years ahead, especially as the international community
    seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in States recovering
    from conflict (Goldsmith and Sheptycki, 2007) With transnational police development-aid
    the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are
    questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between
    jurisdictions (Hills, 2009).
  question: What concern did Hills raise about power imbalances?
- answer: Prussians were angered by what they considered a British betrayal in 1762
  context: "The war had also brought to an end the \"Old System\" of alliances in\
    \ Europe, In the years after the war, under the direction of Lord Sandwich, the\
    \ British did try to re-establish this system. But after her surprising grand\
    \ success against a coalition of great powers, European states such as Austria,\
    \ The Dutch Republic, Sweden, Denmark-Norway, Ottoman Empire, and Russia now saw\
    \ Britain as a greater threat than France and did not join them, while the Prussians\
    \ were angered by what they considered a British betrayal in 1762. Consequently,\
    \ when the American War of Independence turned into a global war between 1778\u2013\
    83, Britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of European powers, and\
    \ lacking any substantial ally."
  question: What drove Prussia away from renewing its alliance with Britain?
- answer: Opera-mini version
  context: Opera debuted in 1996; it has never achieved widespread use, having less
    than 2% browser usage share as of February 2012 according to Net Applications.
    Its Opera-mini version has an additive share, in April 2011 amounting to 1.1%
    of overall browser use, but focused on the fast-growing mobile phone web browser
    market, being preinstalled on over 40 million phones. It is also available on
    several other embedded systems, including Nintendo's Wii video game console.
  question: What accounted for 1.1% of browser use in April 2011?
- answer: $50 million
  context: On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation
    into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through
    to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of between $50 million and $150
    million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share. The investigation, begun in November
    2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
    over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted. It was alleged
    that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for
    agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer AMD. In 2010 Dell finally
    paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other
    executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting
    or denying the charges.
  question: What was the minimum amount of earnings that would be restated by Dell's
    investigation?
- answer: over three million volumes
  context: The library system also includes branch libraries for Architecture, Chemistry
    & Physics, Engineering, Law, and Mathematics as well as information centers in
    the Mendoza College of Business, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies,
    the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, and a slide library
    in O'Shaughnessy Hall. A theology library was also opened in fall of 2015. Located
    on the first floor of Stanford Hall, it is the first branch of the library system
    to be housed in a dorm room. The library system holds over three million volumes,
    was the single largest university library in the world upon its completion, and
    remains one of the 100 largest libraries in the country.
  question: How many books are held by the Notre Dame libraries?
- answer: Asturias
  context: "Later the Muslims invaded Spain (711), but the Arabs and Moors never managed\
    \ to have any real control over Galicia, which was later incorporated into the\
    \ expanding Christian Kingdom of Asturias, usually known as Gallaecia or Galicia\
    \ (Yill\u012Bqiya and Gal\u012Bsiya) by Muslim Chroniclers, as well as by many\
    \ European contemporaries. This era consolidated Galicia as a Christian society\
    \ which spoke a Romance language. During the next century Galician noblemen took\
    \ northern Portugal, conquering Coimbra in 871, thus freeing what were considered\
    \ the southernmost city of ancient Galicia."
  question: Which kingdom did Galicia later become a part of?
- answer: Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park
  context: 'Hyderabad''s lakes and the sloping terrain of its low-lying hills provide
    habitat for an assortment of flora and fauna. The forest region in and around
    the city encompasses areas of ecological and biological importance, which are
    preserved in the form of national parks, zoos, mini-zoos and a wildlife sanctuary.
    Nehru Zoological Park, the city''s one large zoo, is the first in India to have
    a lion and tiger safari park. Hyderabad has three national parks (Mrugavani National
    Park, Mahavir Harina Vanasthali National Park and Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National

  question: Two of the national parks in Hyderabad are Mrugavani National Park, Mahavir
    Harina Vanasthali National Park, what is the third?
- answer: Crazy in Love
  context: "Her debut single, \"Crazy in Love\" was named VH1's \"Greatest Song of\
    \ the 2000s\", NME's \"Best Track of the 00s\" and \"Pop Song of the Century\"\
    , considered by Rolling Stone to be one of the 500 greatest songs of all time,\
    \ earned two Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling singles of all time\
    \ at around 8 million copies. The music video for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring\
    \ on It)\", which achieved fame for its intricate choreography and its deployment\
    \ of jazz hands, was credited by the Toronto Star as having started the \"first\
    \ major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet\", triggering\
    \ a number of parodies of the dance choreography and a legion of amateur imitators\
    \ on YouTube. In 2013, Drake released a single titled \"Girls Love Beyonc\xE9\"\
    , which featured an interpolation from Destiny Child's \"Say My Name\" and discussed\
    \ his relationship with women. In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard\
    \ named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse fly found in Northern Queensland,\

  question: VH1 declared what song the "Greatest song of the 2000s?"
- answer: Lexington and Concord
  context: The American Revolution begun with fighting at Lexington and Concord. On
    July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed their
    independence from Great Britain and their formation of a cooperative union. In
    June 1776, Benjamin Franklin was appointed a member of the Committee of Five that
    drafted the Declaration of Independence. Although he was temporarily disabled
    by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, Franklin made several
    small changes to the draft sent to him by Thomas Jefferson.
  question: Where did the American Revolution start?
- answer: Charles Darwin
  context: On the Origin of Species, published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific
    literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary
    biology. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve
    over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented
    a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through
    a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered
    on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research,
    correspondence, and experimentation.
  question: Who wrote The Origin of Species?
- answer: prayer
  context: All sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective.
    Pliny the Elder declared that "a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless
    and not a proper consultation of the gods." Prayer by itself, however, had independent
    power. The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action, and knowledge
    of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy. Accurate naming was vital
    for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked, hence the proliferation
    of cult epithets among Roman deities. Public prayers (prex) were offered loudly
    and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community. Public religious ritual had
    to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly; a mistake might require
    that the action, or even the entire festival, be repeated from the start. The
    historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin
    festival forgot to include the "Roman people" among the list of beneficiaries
    in his prayer; the festival had to be started over. Even private prayer by an
    individual was formulaic, a recitation rather than a personal expression, though
    selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion.
  question: What did each offering require to be valid in Roman religion?
- answer: Marana
  context: The expansive area northwest of the city limits is diverse, ranging from
    the rural communities of Catalina and parts of the town of Marana, the small suburb
    of Picture Rocks, the affluent town of Oro Valley in the western foothills of
    the Santa Catalina Mountains, and residential areas in the northeastern foothills
    of the Tucson Mountains. Continental Ranch (Marana), Dove Mountain (Marana), and
    Rancho Vistoso (Oro Valley) are all masterplanned communities located in the Northwest,
    where thousands of residents live.
  question: Which town would you find Dove Mountain and Continental Ranch?
- answer: '1796'
  context: "Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not develop to the extent that\
    \ contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that\
    \ much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (\u0633\u062C\u0639, also\
    \ transliterated as seci), or rhymed prose, a type of writing descended from the\
    \ Arabic saj' and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a string\
    \ of words, such as a sentence, there must be a rhyme. Nevertheless, there was\
    \ a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional\
    \ in nature. One apparent exception was Muhayyel\xE2t (\"Fancies\") by Giritli\
    \ Ali Aziz Efendi, a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796, though\
    \ not published until 1867. The first novel published in the Ottoman Empire was\
    \ by an Armenian named Vartan Pasha. Published in 1851, the novel was entitled\
    \ The Story of Akabi (Turkish: Akabi Hikyayesi) and was written in Turkish but\
    \ with Armenian script."
  question: "When was Muhayyel\xE2t written?"
- answer: 663,000 copies
  context: "The remaining band members recorded \"Independent Women Part I\", which\
    \ appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, Charlie's Angels. It became their\
    \ best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive\
    \ weeks. In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album,\
    \ Beyonc\xE9 landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen:\
    \ A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia,\
    \ the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th century opera Carmen by French\
    \ composer Georges Bizet. When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001,\
    \ Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them.\
    \ The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales\
    \ of 663,000 copies sold. The album spawned other number-one hits, \"Bootylicious\"\
    \ and the title track, \"Survivor\", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy\
    \ Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. After releasing\
    \ their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced\
    \ a hiatus to further pursue solo careers."
  question: Their third album, Survivor, sold how many during its first week?
- answer: Standard Mandarin
  context: Unlike most languages that use alphabets to indicate the pronunciation,
    Chinese characters have developed from logograms that do not always give hints
    to its pronunciation. Although the written characters remained relatively consistent
    for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions
    has developed to an extent that the varieties of the spoken language are often
    mutually unintelligible. As a series of migration to the south throughout the
    history, the regional languages of the south, including Xiang, Wu, Gan, Min, Yue
    (Cantonese), and Hakka often show traces of Old Chinese or Middle Chinese. From
    the Ming dynasty onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect
    spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding
    of the Republic of China, Standard Mandarin was designated as the official language,
    based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are
    regarded as fangyan (dialects). Cantonese is still the most commonly used language
    in Hong Kong, Macau and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas Southern
    Min has been accepted in Taiwan as an important local language along with Mandarin.
  question: At its founding. what was the official language of the Republic of China?
- answer: Communism
  context: Some critiqued Paul VI's decision; the newly created Synod of Bishops had
    an advisory role only and could not make decisions on their own, although the
    Council decided exactly that. During the pontificate of Paul VI, five such synods
    took place, and he is on record of implementing all their decisions. Related questions
    were raised about the new National Bishop Conferences, which became mandatory
    after Vatican II. Others questioned his Ostpolitik and contacts with Communism
    and the deals he engaged in for the faithful.
  question: What political movement was Paul VI criticized for having a relationship
    with?
- answer: balladry
  context: Lancashire has a long and highly productive tradition of music making.
    In the early modern era the county shared in the national tradition of balladry,
    including perhaps the finest border ballad, "The Ballad of Chevy Chase", thought
    to have been composed by the Lancashire-born minstrel Richard Sheale. The county
    was also a common location for folk songs, including "The Lancashire Miller",
    "Warrington Ale" and "The soldier's farewell to Manchester", while Liverpool,
    as a major seaport, was the subject of many sea shanties, including "The Leaving
    of Liverpool" and "Maggie May", beside several local Wassailing songs. In the
    Industrial Revolution changing social and economic patterns helped create new
    traditions and styles of folk song, often linked to migration and patterns of
    work. These included processional dances, often associated with rushbearing or
    the Wakes Week festivities, and types of step dance, most famously clog dancing.
  question: What did the county share with it's national traditions?
- answer: latency
  context: In contrast to the speed of compression, which is proportional to the number
    of operations required by the algorithm, here latency refers to the number of
    samples that must be analysed before a block of audio is processed. In the minimum
    case, latency is zero samples (e.g., if the coder/decoder simply reduces the number
    of bits used to quantize the signal). Time domain algorithms such as LPC also
    often have low latencies, hence their popularity in speech coding for telephony.
    In algorithms such as MP3, however, a large number of samples have to be analyzed
    to implement a psychoacoustic model in the frequency domain, and latency is on
    the order of 23 ms (46 ms for two-way communication)).
  question: What has zero samples in a minimum case?
- answer: rare
  context: A samurai could divorce his wife for a variety of reasons with approval
    from a superior, but divorce was, while not entirely nonexistent, a rare event.
    A wife's failure to produce a son was cause for divorce, but adoption of a male
    heir was considered an acceptable alternative to divorce. A samurai could divorce
    for personal reasons, even if he simply did not like his wife, but this was generally
    avoided as it would embarrass the person who had arranged the marriage. A woman
    could also arrange a divorce, although it would generally take the form of the
    samurai divorcing her. After a divorce samurai had to return the betrothal money,
    which often prevented divorces.
  question: How common was divorce for samurai?
- answer: December 12
  context: On June 12, 1990, the Congress of People's Deputies adopted the Declaration
    of State Sovereignty. On June 12, 1991, Boris Yeltsin was elected the first President.
    On December 8, 1991, heads of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed the Belavezha
    Accords. The agreement declared dissolution of the USSR by its founder states
    (i.e. denunciation of 1922 Treaty on the Creation of the USSR) and established
    the CIS. On December 12, the agreement was ratified by the Russian Parliament,
    therefore Russian SFSR denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and de
    facto declared Russia's independence from the USSR.
  question: When did the Russian Parliament ratify the Belavezha Accords?
- answer: Curly McClain
  context: In Sand Springs, an outdoor amphitheater called "Discoveryland!" is the
    official performance headquarters for the musical Oklahoma! Ridge Bond, native
    of McAlester, Oklahoma, starred in the Broadway and International touring productions
    of Oklahoma!, playing the role of "Curly McClain" in more than 2,600 performances.
    In 1953 he was featured along with the Oklahoma! cast on a CBS Omnibus television
    broadcast. Bond was instrumental in the title song becoming the Oklahoma state
    song and is also featured on the U.S. postage stamp commemorating the musical's
    50th anniversary. Historically, the state has produced musical styles such as
    The Tulsa Sound and western swing, which was popularized at Cain's Ballroom in
    Tulsa. The building, known as the "Carnegie Hall of Western Swing", served as
    the performance headquarters of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys during the 1930s.
    Stillwater is known as the epicenter of Red Dirt music, the best-known proponent
    of which is the late Bob Childers.
  question: Who did Ridge Bond play?
- answer: indirectly
  context: Alternatively, or in addition to this practice, the members of an upper
    house may be indirectly elected by the government or legislature of the component
    states, as occurred in the United States prior to 1913, or be actual members or
    delegates of the state governments, as, for example, is the case in the German
    Bundesrat and in the Council of the European Union. The lower house of a federal
    legislature is usually directly elected, with apportionment in proportion to population,
    although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of
    seats.
  question: Can the members of the upper house be elected directly or indirectly?
- answer: June 2013
  context: "In the early 21st century, the population of Paris began to increase slowly\
    \ again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in\
    \ 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delano\xEB became the first socialist mayor of\
    \ Paris. In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic in the city, he introduced\
    \ the V\xE9lib', a system which rents bicycles for the use of local residents\
    \ and visitors. Bertrand Delano\xEB also transformed a section of the highway\
    \ along the left bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade\
    \ des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013."
  question: When was the Promenade des Berges de la Seine inaugurated?

  context: "During the reign of Mithridates I of Parthia, Arsacid control expanded\
    \ to include Herat (in 167 BC), Babylonia (in 144 BC), Media (in 141 BC), Persia\
    \ (in 139 BC), and large parts of Syria (in the 110s BC). The Seleucid\u2013Parthian\
    \ wars continued as the Seleucids invaded Mesopotamia under Antiochus VII Sidetes\
    \ (r. 138\u2013129 BC), but he was eventually killed by a Parthian counterattack.\
    \ After the fall of the Seleucid dynasty, the Parthians fought frequently against\
    \ neighbouring Rome in the Roman\u2013Parthian Wars (66 BC \u2013 217 AD). Abundant\
    \ traces of Hellenism continued under the Parthian empire. The Parthians used\
    \ Greek as well as their own Parthian language (though lesser than Greek) as languages\
    \ of administration and also used Greek drachmas as coinage. They enjoyed Greek\
    \ theater and Greek art influenced Parthian art. The Parthians continued worhipping\
    \ Greek gods syncretized together with Iranian deities. Their rulers established\
    \ ruler cults in the manner of Hellenistic kings and often used Hellenistic royal\

  question: "What years were the Roman\u2013Parthian Wars?"
- answer: '40'
  context: Long a major population center and site of worldwide automobile manufacturing,
    Detroit has suffered a long economic decline produced by numerous factors. Like
    many industrial American cities, Detroit reached its population peak in the 1950
    census. The peak population was 1.8 million people. Following suburbanization,
    industrial restructuring, and loss of jobs (as described above), by the 2010 census,
    the city had less than 40 percent of that number, with just over 700,000 residents.
    The city has declined in population in each census since 1950.
  question: By how much in percent has the population of Detroit declined since 1950?
- answer: environmental
  context: Hunting is primarily regulated by state law; additional regulations are
    imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds
    and endangered species. Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern
    the areas, time periods, techniques and methods by which specific game animals
    may be hunted. Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected
    species (often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations).
    Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states, for which
    completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite.
  question: What additional type of law applies in the case of migratory birds and
    endangered species?
- answer: two (or more)
  context: Incandescent light bulbs consist of an air-tight glass enclosure (the envelope,
    or bulb) with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb, through which an electric
    current is passed. Contact wires and a base with two (or more) conductors provide
    electrical connections to the filament. Incandescent light bulbs usually contain
    a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb's base that allows the electrical contacts
    to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks. Small wires embedded in
    the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires.
  question: How many conductors are present in the bulb's base?
- answer: Oliver Cromwell
  context: It suffered damage during the turbulent 1640s, when it was attacked by
    Puritan iconoclasts, but was again protected by its close ties to the state during
    the Commonwealth period. Oliver Cromwell was given an elaborate funeral there
    in 1658, only to be disinterred in January 1661 and posthumously hanged from a
    gibbet at Tyburn.
  question: Who had a fancy funeral at the abbey in 1658?
- answer: "Hotel de la Collectivit\xE9"
  context: "Saint Barth\xE9lemy was for many years a French commune forming part of\
    \ Guadeloupe, which is an overseas region and department of France. Through a\
    \ referendum in 2003, island residents sought separation from the administrative\
    \ jurisdiction of Guadeloupe, and it was finally accomplished in 2007. The island\
    \ of Saint Barth\xE9lemy became an Overseas Collectivity (COM). A governing territorial\
    \ council was elected for its administration, which has provided the island with\
    \ a certain degree of autonomy. The Hotel de Ville, which was the town hall, is\
    \ now the Hotel de la Collectivit\xE9. A senator represents the island in Paris.\
    \ St. Barth\xE9lemy has retained its free port status."
  question: What is the current name of the building in St. Barts that serves as town
    hall?
- answer: chipmunk soul
  context: "West's musical career has been defined by frequent stylistic shifts, and\
    \ has seen him develop and explore a variety of different musical approaches and\
    \ genres throughout his work. When asked about his musical inspirations, he has\
    \ named A Tribe Called Quest, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, George Michael,\
    \ LL Cool J, Phil Collins and Madonna as early interests. He has further described\
    \ musician David Bowie as one of his \"most important inspirations,\" and named\
    \ producer Puff Daddy as the \"most important cultural figure in my life.\" Early\
    \ in his career, West pioneered a style of production dubbed \"chipmunk soul\"\
    \ which utilized pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul and R&B songs, along\
    \ with his own drums and instrumentation. His first major release featuring his\
    \ trademark soulful vocal sampling style was \"This Can't Be Life\", a track from\
    \ Jay-Z\u2019s The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. West has said that Wu-Tang Clan producer\
    \ RZA influenced him in his style, and has named Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface Killah\
    \ and Ol' Dirty Bastard as inspirations. RZA spoke positively of the comparisons,\
    \ stating in an interview for Rolling Stone, \"All good. I got super respect for\
    \ Kanye [...] [he] is going to inspire people to be like him.\" West further developed\
    \ his style on his 2004 debut album, The College Dropout. After a rough version\
    \ was leaked, he meticulously refined the production, adding string arrangements,\
    \ gospel choirs, and improved drum programming."

  question: What sportswear company has a deal with the University of Kansas?
- answer: mechanism of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity
  context: 'Antibacterial antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism
    of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity. Most target bacterial
    functions or growth processes. Those that target the bacterial cell wall (penicillins
    and cephalosporins) or the cell membrane (polymyxins), or interfere with essential
    bacterial enzymes (rifamycins, lipiarmycins, quinolones, and sulfonamides) have
    bactericidal activities. Those that target protein synthesis (macrolides, lincosamides
    and tetracyclines) are usually bacteriostatic (with the exception of bactericidal
    aminoglycosides). Further categorization is based on their target specificity.
    "Narrow-spectrum" antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria,
    such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, whereas broad-spectrum antibiotics
    affect a wide range of bacteria. Following a 40-year hiatus in discovering new
    classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibacterial antibiotics
    have been brought into clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s: cyclic
    lipopeptides (such as daptomycin), glycylcyclines (such as tigecycline), oxazolidinones
    (such as linezolid), and lipiarmycins (such as fidaxomicin).'
  question: What three ways are antibiotics classified?
- answer: home field advantage
  context: It also used to be commonplace to have a team play an exhibition against
    Minor League affiliates during the regular season, but worries of injuries to
    players, along with travel issues, have made this very rare. Exhibitions between
    inter-city teams in different leagues, like Chicago's Crosstown Classic and New
    York's Subway Series which used to be played solely as exhibitions for bragging
    rights are now blended into interleague play. The annual MLB All-Star Game, played
    in July between players from AL teams and players from NL teams, was long considered
    an exhibition match, but as of 2003 this status was questioned because the league
    whose team wins the All-Star game has been awarded home field advantage for the
    upcoming World Series.
  question: What did the MLB All-Star winning team gain in the World Series?
- answer: great-great-grandmother
  context: Elizabeth's many historic visits and meetings include a state visit to
    the Republic of Ireland and reciprocal visits to and from the Pope. She has seen
    major constitutional changes, such as devolution in the United Kingdom, Canadian
    patriation, and the decolonisation of Africa. She has also reigned through various
    wars and conflicts involving many of her realms. She is the world's oldest reigning
    monarch as well as Britain's longest-lived. In 2015, she surpassed the reign of
    her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-reigning British
    head of state and the longest-reigning queen regnant in world history.
  question: How is Victoria related to Elizabeth?
- answer: digging tunnels
  context: An urban civilization, the Garamantes, arose around 500 BCE in the heart
    of the Sahara, in a valley that is now called the Wadi al-Ajal in Fezzan, Libya.
    The Garamantes achieved this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains
    flanking the valley to tap fossil water and bring it to their fields. The Garamantes
    grew populous and strong, conquering their neighbors and capturing many slaves
    (which were put to work extending the tunnels). The ancient Greeks and the Romans
    knew of the Garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads. However, they
    traded with the Garamantes, and a Roman bath has been found in the Garamantes
    capital of Garama. Archaeologists have found eight major towns and many other
    important settlements in the Garamantes territory. The Garamantes civilization
    eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the aquifers and
    could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains.
  question: What did the Garamantes do in order to bring water to   their crops?
- answer: introduced the perestroika and glasnost reforms.
  context: The Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The
    United States under President Ronald Reagan increased diplomatic, military, and
    economic pressure on the Soviet Union, which was already suffering from severe
    economic stagnation. In the second half of the 1980s, newly appointed Soviet leader
    Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the perestroika and glasnost reforms. The Soviet
    Union collapsed in 1991, leaving the United States as the dominant military power,
    though Russia retained much of the massive Soviet nuclear arsenal.
  question: What did Mikhail Gorbachev introduce?
- answer: Alfred Tarski
  context: Hayek had a long-standing and close friendship with philosopher of science
    Karl Popper, also from Vienna. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated, "I
    think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps
    Alfred Tarski." (See Hacohen, 2000). Popper dedicated his Conjectures and Refutations
    to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, Studies in Philosophy,
    Politics, and Economics, to Popper and, in 1982, said that "ever since his Logik
    der Forschung first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general
    theory of methodology". Popper also participated in the inaugural meeting of the
    Mont Pelerin Society. Their friendship and mutual admiration, however, do not
    change the fact that there are important differences between their ideas.
  question: Who is the only exception from whom Hayek claims to have learned more
    than he did from Popper?
- answer: 72,000
  context: "On 20 April 1992, The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert was held at London's\
    \ Wembley Stadium to a 72,000-strong crowd. Performers, including Def Leppard,\
    \ Robert Plant, Guns N' Roses, Elton John, David Bowie, George Michael, Annie\
    \ Lennox, Seal, Extreme, and Metallica performed various Queen songs along with\
    \ the three remaining Queen members (and Spike Edney.) The concert is listed in\
    \ the Guinness Book of Records as \"The largest rock star benefit concert\", as\
    \ it was televised to over 1.2 billion viewers worldwide, and raised over \xA3\
    20,000,000 for AIDS charities."
  question: How many people attended the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert?
- answer: '100'
  context: The family of instruments used, especially in orchestras, grew. A wider
    array of percussion instruments began to appear. Brass instruments took on larger
    roles, as the introduction of rotary valves made it possible for them to play
    a wider range of notes. The size of the orchestra (typically around 40 in the
    Classical era) grew to be over 100. Gustav Mahler's 1906 Symphony No. 8, for example,
    has been performed with over 150 instrumentalists and choirs of over 400.
  question: To what number did the size of the orchestra grow to?
- answer: 1 January
  context: Most Western European countries changed the start of the year to 1 January
    before they adopted the Gregorian calendar. For example, Scotland changed the
    start of the Scottish New Year to 1 January in 1600 (this means that 1599 was
    a short year). England, Ireland and the British colonies changed the start of
    the year to 1 January in 1752 (so 1751 was a short year with only 282 days) though
    in England the start of the tax year remained at 25 March (O.S.), 5 April (N.S.)
    till 1800, when it moved to 6 April. Later in 1752 in September the Gregorian
    calendar was introduced throughout Britain and the British colonies (see the section
    Adoption). These two reforms were implemented by the Calendar (New Style) Act
    1750.
  question: On what date did most European countries set the start of the new year?
- answer: Aloysius Stepinac
  context: "Prime Minister Josip Broz Tito met with the president of the Bishops'\
    \ Conference of Yugoslavia, Aloysius Stepinac on 4 June 1945, two days after his\
    \ release from imprisonment. The two could not reach an agreement on the state\
    \ of the Catholic Church. Under Stepinac's leadership, the bishops' conference\
    \ released a letter condemning alleged Partisan war crimes in September, 1945.\
    \ The following year Stepinac was arrested and put on trial. In October 1946,\
    \ in its first special session for 75 years, the Vatican excommunicated Tito and\
    \ the Yugoslav government for sentencing Stepinac to 16 years in prison on charges\
    \ of assisting Usta\u0161e terror and of supporting forced conversions of Serbs\
    \ to Catholicism. Stepinac received preferential treatment in recognition of his\
    \ status and the sentence was soon shortened and reduced to house-arrest, with\
    \ the option of emigration open to the archbishop. At the conclusion of the \"\
    Informbiro period\", reforms rendered Yugoslavia considerably more religiously\
    \ liberal than the Eastern Bloc states."
  question: Who was the president of the Bishops' Conference of Yugoslavia?
- answer: 3.5 million
  context: "Armenians have had a presence in the Armenian Highland for over four thousand\
    \ years, since the time when Hayk, the legendary patriarch and founder of the\
    \ first Armenian nation, led them to victory over Bel of Babylon. Today, with\
    \ a population of 3.5 million, they not only constitute an overwhelming majority\
    \ in Armenia, but also in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians in\
    \ the diaspora informally refer to them as Hayastantsis (\u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\
    \u057D\u057F\u0561\u0576\u0581\u056B), meaning those that are from Armenia (that\
    \ is, those born and raised in Armenia). They, as well as the Armenians of Iran\
    \ and Russia speak the Eastern dialect of the Armenian language. The country itself\
    \ is secular as a result of Soviet domination, but most of its citizens identify\
    \ themselves as Apostolic Armenian Christian."
  question: How many native Armenians are in Armenia today?
- answer: Hoh Rain Forest
  context: "From 1981 to 2010, the average annual precipitation measured at Seattle\u2013\
    Tacoma International Airport was 37.49 inches (952 mm). Annual precipitation has\
    \ ranged from 23.78 in (604 mm) in 1952 to 55.14 in (1,401 mm) in 1950; for water\
    \ year (October 1 \u2013 September 30) precipitation, the range is 23.16 in (588\
    \ mm) in 1976\u201377 to 51.82 in (1,316 mm) in 1996\u201397. Due to local variations\
    \ in microclimate, Seattle also receives significantly lower precipitation than\
    \ some other locations west of the Cascades. Around 80 mi (129 km) to the west,\
    \ the Hoh Rain Forest in Olympic National Park on the western flank of the Olympic\
    \ Mountains receives an annual average precipitation of 142 in (3.61 m). Sixty\

    \ 50 in (1,270 mm). The city of Bremerton, about 15 mi (24 km) west of downtown\
    \ Seattle, receives 56.4 in (1,430 mm) of precipitation annually."
  question: Where on the Olympic Peninsula does the rainfall average 142 inches a
    year?
- answer: English and Scotch-Irish
  context: "In 2000, the five most common self-reported ethnic groups in the state\
    \ were: American (17.3%), African American (13.0%), Irish (9.3%), English (9.1%),\
    \ and German (8.3%). Most Tennesseans who self-identify as having American ancestry\
    \ are of English and Scotch-Irish ancestry. An estimated 21\u201324% of Tennesseans\
    \ are of predominantly English ancestry. In the 1980 census 1,435,147 Tennesseans\

    \ of 3,221,354 making them 45% of the state at the time."
  question: Which European ancestries are most common among self-identified ethnic
    "Americans" in Tennessee?
- answer: dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception as an "over-elaboration"
  context: Contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the dogmatic declaration
    of her immaculate conception as an "over-elaboration" of the faith and because
    they see it as too closely connected with a particular interpretation of the doctrine
    of ancestral sin. All the same, the historical and authentic tradition of Mariology
    in Byzantium took its historical point of departure from Sophronios, Damascene,
    and their imitators. The most famous Eastern Orthodox theologian to imply Mary's
    Immaculate Conception was St. Gregory Palamas. Though many passages from his works
    were long known to extol and attribute to Mary a Christlike holiness in her human
    nature, traditional objections to Palamas' disposition toward the Immaculate Conception
    typically rely on a poor understanding of his doctrine of "the purification of
    Mary" at the Annunciation. Not only did he explicitly cite St. Gregory Nazianzen
    for his understanding of Jesus' purification at His baptism and Mary's at the
    Annunciation, but Theophanes of Nicaea, Joseph Bryennius, and Gennadios Scholarios
    all explicitly placed Mary's Conception as the first moment of her all-immaculate
    participation in the divine energies to such a degree that she was always completely
    without spot and graced. In addition to Emperor Manuel II and Gennadius Scholarius,
    St. Mark of Ephesus also fervently defended Mary's title as "prepurified" against
    the Dominican, Manuel Calecas, who was perhaps promoting thomistic Mariology that
    denied Mary's all-holiness from the first moment of her existence.
  question: What does this group believe of the story of a Virgin mother for Mary
    and those who follow its teaching ?
- answer: Pebble mosaics
  context: Mosaic has a long history, starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium
    BC. Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece; mosaics with patterns
    and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in Ancient Greece and
    Ancient Rome. Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated
    with wall and ceiling mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from
    the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom
    in Sicily in the 12th century, by eastern-influenced Venice, and among the Rus
    in Ukraine. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance, though artists like
    Raphael continued to practise the old technique. Roman and Byzantine influence
    led Jews to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor
    mosaics.
  question: What kind of mosaic were made in Tiryns?
- answer: by means of a lakefill in Lake Michigan
  context: Northwestern's Evanston campus, where the undergraduate schools, the Graduate
    School, and the Kellogg School of Management are located, runs north-south from
    Lincoln Avenue to Clark Street west of Lake Michigan along Sheridan Road. North
    and South Campuses have noticeably different atmospheres, owing to the predominance
    of Science and Athletics in the one and Humanities and Arts in the other. North
    Campus is home to the fraternity quads, the Henry Crown Sports Pavilion and Norris
    Aquatics Center and other athletic facilities, the Technological Institute, Dearborn
    Observatory, and other science-related buildings including Patrick G. and Shirley
    W. Ryan Hall for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly, and the Ford Motor
    Company Engineering Design Center. South Campus is home to the University's humanities
    buildings, Pick-Staiger Concert Hall and other music buildings, the Mary and Leigh
    Block Museum of Art, and the sorority quads. In the 1960s, the University created
    an additional 84 acres (34.0 ha) by means of a lakefill in Lake Michigan. Among
    some of the buildings located on these broad new acres are University Library,
    Norris University Center (the student union), and Pick-Staiger Concert Hall.
  question: How did Northwestern create 84 additional acres in the 1960's?

- answer: Turkey
  context: "In 2014, Turkey was ordered by the European Court of Human Rights to pay\
    \ well over $100m in compensation to Cyprus for the invasion; Ankara announced\
    \ that it would ignore the judgment. In 2014, a group of Cypriot refugees and\
    \ a European parliamentarian, later joined by the Cypriot government, filed a\
    \ complaint to the International Court of Justice, accusing Turkey of violating\
    \ the Geneva Conventions by directly or indirectly transferring its civilian population\
    \ into occupied territory. Over the preceding ten years, civilian transfer by\
    \ Turkey had \"reached new heights\", in the words of one US ambassador.[f] Other\
    \ violations of the Geneva and the Hague Conventions\u2014both ratified by Turkey\u2014\
    amount to what archaeologist Sophocles Hadjisavvas called \"the organized destruction\
    \ of Greek and Christian heritage in the north\". These violations include looting\
    \ of cultural treasures, deliberate destruction of churches, neglect of works\
    \ of art, and altering the names of important historical sites, which was condemned\
    \ by the International Council on Monuments and Sites. Hadjisavvas has asserted\

  context: 'Numerous recordings of Chopin''s works are available. On the occasion
    of the composer''s bicentenary, the critics of The New York Times recommended
    performances by the following contemporary pianists (among many others): Martha
    Argerich, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Emanuel Ax, Evgeny Kissin, Murray Perahia, Maurizio
    Pollini and Krystian Zimerman. The Warsaw Chopin Society organizes the Grand prix
    du disque de F. Chopin for notable Chopin recordings, held every five years.'
  question: Who organizes the Grand prix du disque de F. Chopin for notable Chopin
    recordings?
- answer: similar molecules without biotic content
  context: Fungi communicate to coordinate and organize their growth and development
    such as the formation of Marcelia and fruiting bodies. Fungi communicate with
    their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great
    variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, unicellular eukaryote,
    plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin. The biochemicals trigger
    the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical
    molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism
    to react. This implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules
    taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation.
    So far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different
    behavioral patterns such as filamentation, mating, growth, and pathogenicity.
    Behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through
    interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self,
    a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species,
    and even filter out "noise", i.e. similar molecules without biotic content.
  question: What is an example of "noise" that is filtered out through the interpretation
    processes?
- answer: The Giving of Love
  context: "On the evening of May 18, CCTV-1 hosted a special four-hour program called\
    \ The Giving of Love (simplified Chinese: \u7231\u7684\u5949\u732E; traditional\
    \ Chinese: \u611B\u7684\u5949\u737B), hosted by regulars from the CCTV New Year's\

  question: What was the program that CCTV-1 hosted?
- answer: the Safavids
  context: "During his brief majority reign, Murad IV (1612\u20131640) reasserted\
    \ central authority and recaptured Iraq (1639) from the Safavids. The resulting\
    \ Treaty of Zuhab of that same year decisively parted the Caucasus and adjacent\
    \ regions between the two neighbouring empires as it had already been defined\
    \ in the 1555 Peace of Amasya. The Sultanate of women (1648\u20131656) was a period\
    \ in which the mothers of young sultans exercised power on behalf of their sons.\
    \ The most prominent women of this period were K\xF6sem Sultan and her daughter-in-law\
    \ Turhan Hatice, whose political rivalry culminated in K\xF6sem's murder in 1651.\
    \ During the K\xF6pr\xFCl\xFC Era (1656\u20131703), effective control of the Empire\
    \ was exercised by a sequence of Grand Viziers from the K\xF6pr\xFCl\xFC family.\
    \ The K\xF6pr\xFCl\xFC Vizierate saw renewed military success with authority restored\
    \ in Transylvania, the conquest of Crete completed in 1669, and expansion into\
    \ Polish southern Ukraine, with the strongholds of Khotyn and Kamianets-Podilskyi\
    \ and the territory of Podolia ceding to Ottoman control in 1676."
  question: Who had control over Iraq before it was recaptured in 1639?
- answer: 146 BC
  context: After a period of confusion following Alexander's death, the Antigonid
    dynasty, descended from one of Alexander's generals, established its control over
    Macedon and most of the Greek city-states by 276 BC. From about 200 BC the Roman
    Republic became increasingly involved in Greek affairs and engaged in a series
    of wars with Macedon. Macedon's defeat at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC signalled
    the end of Antigonid power in Greece. In 146 BC Macedonia was annexed as a province
    by Rome, and the rest of Greece became a Roman protectorate.
  question: In what year did Greece become a part of Rome?
- answer: Game Developers Conference
  context: In 2003, Nintendo announced that a new The Legend of Zelda game was in
    the works for the GameCube by the same team that had created the cel-shaded The
    Wind Waker. At the following year's Game Developers Conference, director Eiji
    Aonuma unintentionally revealed that the game's sequel was in development under
    the working title The Wind Waker 2; it was set to use a similar graphical style
    to that of its predecessor. Nintendo of America told Aonuma that North American
    sales of The Wind Waker were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the
    impression that the game was designed for a young audience. Concerned that the
    sequel would have the same problem, Aonuma expressed to producer Shigeru Miyamoto
    that he wanted to create a realistic Zelda game that would appeal to the North
    American market. Miyamoto, hesitant about solely changing the game's presentation,
    suggested the team's focus should instead be on coming up with gameplay innovations.
    He advised that Aonuma should start by doing what could not be done in Ocarina
    of Time, particularly horseback combat.[l]
  question: At what event was a potential follow-up to The Wind Waker mentioned?
- answer: 13%
  context: "The West Bank was annexed by Jordan in 1950, following the Arab rejection\
    \ of the UN decision to create two states in Palestine. Only Britain recognized\
    \ this annexation and Jordan has since ceded its claim to the territory to the\
    \ PLO. The West Bank was occupied by Israel in 1967 during the Six-Day War. The\
    \ population are mainly Palestinians, including refugees of the 1948 Arab-Israeli\
    \ War. From their occupation in 1967 until 1993, the Palestinians living in these\
    \ territories were under Israeli military administration. Since the Israel\u2013\
    PLO letters of recognition, most of the Palestinian population and cities have\
    \ been under the internal jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, and only\
    \ partial Israeli military control, although Israel has on several occasions redeployed\
    \ its troops and reinstated full military administration during periods of unrest.\
    \ In response to increasing attacks as part of the Second Intifada, the Israeli\
    \ government started to construct the Israeli West Bank barrier. When completed,\
    \ approximately 13% of the Barrier will be constructed on the Green Line or in\
    \ Israel with 87% inside the West Bank."
  question: What percentage of the barrier will be constructed on the Green Line?
- answer: declared Emperor Napoleon III
  context: Russell's ministry, though Whig, was not favoured by the Queen. She found
    particularly offensive the Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, who often acted
    without consulting the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, or the Queen. Victoria complained
    to Russell that Palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without
    her knowledge, but Palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his
    own initiative, despite her repeated remonstrances. It was only in 1851 that Palmerston
    was removed after he announced the British government's approval of President
    Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte's coup in France without consulting the Prime Minister.
    The following year, President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III, by
    which time Russell's administration had been replaced by a short-lived minority
    government led by Lord Derby.
  question: What happened to President Bonaparte in 1852?
- answer: protective
  context: "Humans have shown extreme inventiveness in devising clothing solutions\
    \ to environmental hazards. Examples include: space suits, air conditioned clothing,\
    \ armor, diving suits, swimsuits, bee-keeper gear, motorcycle leathers, high-visibility\
    \ clothing, and other pieces of protective clothing. Meanwhile, the distinction\
    \ between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut\u2014since\
    \ clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed\
    \ for function often consider fashion in their design. Wearing clothes also has\
    \ social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require\
    \ to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes."
  question: What value may clothing designed to be fashionable also have?
- answer: "Since the start of the 1994\u201395 season, the FA Cup has been sponsored."
  context: "Since the start of the 1994\u201395 season, the FA Cup has been sponsored.\
    \ However, to protect the identity of the competition, the sponsored name has\
    \ always included 'The FA Cup' in addition to the sponsor's name, unlike sponsorship\
    \ deals for the League Cup where the word 'cup' is preceded by only the sponsor's\
    \ name. Sponsorship deals run for four years, though \u2013 as in the case of\
    \ E.ON \u2013 one-year extensions may be agreed. Emirates airline is the sponsor\
    \ from 2015 to 2018, renaming the competition as 'The Emirates FA Cup', unlike\
    \ previous editions, which included 'The FA Cup in association with E.ON' and\
    \ 'The FA Cup with Budweiser'."
  question: is the Fa cup sponsered?
- answer: Daytona International Speedway
  context: Various auto racing organizations hold exhibition events; these events
    usually award no championship points to participants, but they do offer prize
    money to participants. The NASCAR Sprint Cup Series holds two exhibition events
    annually - the Sprint Unlimited, held at Daytona International Speedway at the
    start of the season, and the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, held at Charlotte Motor
    Speedway midway through the season. Both events carry a hefty purse of over USD
    $1,000,000. NASCAR has also held exhibition races at Suzuka Circuit and Twin Ring
    Motegi in Japan and Calder Park Thunderdome in Australia.
  question: Where is the Sprint Unlimited held?

    \ in Rio gather hundreds of thousands of participants. More than 440 blocos operate\
    \ in Rio. Bandas are samba musical bands, also called \"street carnival bands\"\
    , usually formed within a single neighborhood or musical back-ground. The Carnival\
    \ industry chain amassed in 2012 almost US$1 billion in revenues."
  question: How much money in US dollars did the Carnival industry make in 2012?
- answer: Chicago's Lake View neighborhood
  context: Located in Chicago's Lake View neighborhood, Wrigley Field sits on an irregular
    block bounded by Clark and Addison Streets and Waveland and Sheffield Avenues.
    The area surrounding the ballpark is typically referred to as Wrigleyville. There
    is a dense collection of sports bars and restaurants in the area, most with baseball
    inspired themes, including Sluggers, Murphy's Bleachers and The Cubby Bear. Many
    of the apartment buildings surrounding Wrigley Field on Waveland and Sheffield
    Avenues have built bleachers on their rooftops for fans to view games and other
    sell space for advertisement. One building on Sheffield Avenue has a sign atop
    its roof which says "Eamus Catuli!" which is Latin for "Let's Go Cubs!" and another
    chronicles the time since the last Division title, pennant, and World Series championship.
    The 02 denotes two years since the 2008 NL Central title, 65 years since the 1945
    pennant and 102 years since the 1908 World Series championship. On game days,
    many residents rent out their yards and driveways to people looking for parking
    spots. The uniqueness of the neighborhood itself has ingrained itself into the
    culture of the Chicago Cubs as well as the Wrigleyville neighborhood, and has
    led to being used for concerts and other sporting events, such as the 2010 NHL
    Winter Classic between the Chicago Blackhawks and Detroit Red Wings, as well as
    a 2010 NCAA men's football game between the Northwestern Wildcats and Illinois
    Fighting Illini.
  question: Where is Wrigley Field located?
- answer: coconut
  context: The cuisine of Tuvalu is based on the staple of coconut and the many species
    of fish found in the ocean and lagoons of the atolls. Desserts made on the islands
    include coconut and coconut milk, instead of animal milk. The traditional foods
    eaten in Tuvalu are pulaka, taro, bananas, breadfruit and coconut. Tuvaluans also
    eat seafood, including coconut crab and fish from the lagoon and ocean. A traditional
    food source is seabirds (taketake or black noddy and akiaki or white tern), with
    pork being eaten mostly at fateles (or parties with dancing to celebrate events).
  question: What vegetable features in the Tuvalu diet?
- answer: summer
  context: 'The name of local time typically changes when DST is observed. American
    English replaces standard with daylight: for example, Pacific Standard Time (PST)
    becomes Pacific Daylight Time (PDT). In the United Kingdom, the standard term
    for UK time when advanced by one hour is British Summer Time (BST), and British
    English typically inserts summer into other time zone names, e.g. Central European
    Time (CET) becomes Central European Summer Time (CEST).'
  question: What word is often added to the names of time zones when used in British
    English?
- answer: the tone's frequency content
  context: The just-noticeable difference (jnd) (the threshold at which a change is
    perceived) depends on the tone's frequency content. Below 500 Hz, the jnd is about
    3 Hz for sine waves, and 1 Hz for complex tones; above 1000 Hz, the jnd for sine
    waves is about 0.6% (about 10 cents). The jnd is typically tested by playing two
    tones in quick succession with the listener asked if there was a difference in
    their pitches. The jnd becomes smaller if the two tones are played simultaneously
    as the listener is then able to discern beat frequencies. The total number of
    perceptible pitch steps in the range of human hearing is about 1,400; the total
    number of notes in the equal-tempered scale, from 16 to 16,000 Hz, is 120.
  question: The just-noticeable difference, at which a change is perceived depends
    on what?
- answer: attract attention
  context: 'Red, white, and black were the colors of the German Empire from 1870 to
    1918, and as such they came to be associated with German nationalism. In the 1920s
    they were adopted as the colors of the Nazi flag. In Mein Kampf, Hitler explained
    that they were "revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past."
    The red part of the flag was also chosen to attract attention - Hitler wrote:
    "the new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster" because "in hundreds
    of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening
    interest in a movement." The red also symbolized the social program of the Nazis,
    aimed at German workers. Several designs by a number of different authors were
    considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler''s personal design.'
  question: Red was chosen as part of the Nazi flag to do what?
- answer: Phagmodrupa Dynasty
  context: "Wang and Nyima state that after the official title \"Education Minister\"\
    \ was granted to Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen (1302\u20131364) by the Yuan court,\
    \ this title appeared frequently with his name in various Tibetan texts, while\
    \ his Tibetan title \"Degsi\" (sic properly sde-srid or desi) is seldom mentioned.\
    \ Wang and Nyima take this to mean that \"even in the later period of the Yuan\
    \ dynasty, the Yuan imperial court and the Phagmodrupa Dynasty maintained a Central-local\
    \ government relation.\" The Tai Situpa is even supposed to have written in his\
    \ will: \"In the past I received loving care from the emperor in the east. If\
    \ the emperor continues to care for us, please follow his edicts and the imperial\
    \ envoy should be well received.\""
  question: What dynasty kept a Central-local government relation with the Yuan imperial
    court?
- answer: "oracles\u2014principles or mechanisms"
  context: "Although testing can determine the correctness of software under the assumption\
    \ of some specific hypotheses (see hierarchy of testing difficulty below), testing\
    \ cannot identify all the defects within software. Instead, it furnishes a criticism\
    \ or comparison that compares the state and behavior of the product against oracles\u2014\
    principles or mechanisms by which someone might recognize a problem. These oracles\
    \ may include (but are not limited to) specifications, contracts, comparable products,\
    \ past versions of the same product, inferences about intended or expected purpose,\
    \ user or customer expectations, relevant standards, applicable laws, or other\
    \ criteria."
  question: What does the software compare during testing against?
- answer: bodhicitta
  context: Bodhisattva means "enlightenment being", and generally refers to one who
    is on the path to buddhahood. Traditionally, a bodhisattva is anyone who, motivated
    by great compassion, has generated bodhicitta, which is a spontaneous wish to
    attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. Theravada Buddhism primarily
    uses the term in relation to Gautama Buddha's previous existences, but has traditionally
    acknowledged and respected the bodhisattva path as well.[web 17]
  question: What is the term for the spontaneous wish to attain Buddhahood for the
    benefit of all beings?
- answer: both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism
  context: Lithotrophic bacteria can use inorganic compounds as a source of energy.
    Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading
    to nitrification), ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced
    sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic
    bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In
    both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron
    acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead.
    Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are
    heterotrophic.
  question: How can gas methane be used in exceptional set of conditions by methanotrophic
    bacteria?
- answer: capital injection
  context: "Several commentators have suggested that if the liquidity crisis continues,\
    \ an extended recession or worse could occur. The continuing development of the\
    \ crisis has prompted fears of a global economic collapse although there are now\
    \ many cautiously optimistic forecasters in addition to some prominent sources\
    \ who remain negative. The financial crisis is likely to yield the biggest banking\
    \ shakeout since the savings-and-loan meltdown. Investment bank UBS stated on\
    \ October 6 that 2008 would see a clear global recession, with recovery unlikely\
    \ for at least two years. Three days later UBS economists announced that the \"\
    beginning of the end\" of the crisis had begun, with the world starting to make\
    \ the necessary actions to fix the crisis: capital injection by governments; injection\
    \ made systemically; interest rate cuts to help borrowers. The United Kingdom\
    \ had started systemic injection, and the world's central banks were now cutting\
    \ interest rates. UBS emphasized the United States needed to implement systemic\
    \ injection. UBS further emphasized that this fixes only the financial crisis,\
    \ but that in economic terms \"the worst is still to come\". UBS quantified their\
    \ expected recession durations on October 16: the Eurozone's would last two quarters,\
    \ the United States' would last three quarters, and the United Kingdom's would\
    \ last four quarters. The economic crisis in Iceland involved all three of the\
    \ country's major banks. Relative to the size of its economy, Iceland\u2019s banking\
    \ collapse is the largest suffered by any country in economic history."
  question: What was one of the actions taken by government to fix the financial crisis?
- answer: '1776'
  context: "The above \"history of economics\" reflects modern economic textbooks\
    \ and this means that the last stage of a science is represented as the culmination\
    \ of its history (Kuhn, 1962). The \"invisible hand\" mentioned in a lost page\
    \ in the middle of a chapter in the middle of the to \"Wealth of Nations\", 1776,\
    \ advances as Smith's central message.[clarification needed] It is played down\
    \ that this \"invisible hand\" acts only \"frequently\" and that it is \"no part\
    \ of his [the individual's] intentions\" because competition leads to lower prices\
    \ by imitating \"his\" invention. That this \"invisible hand\" prefers \"the support\
    \ of domestic to foreign industry\" is cleansed\u2014often without indication\
    \ that part of the citation is truncated. The opening passage of the \"Wealth\"\
    \ containing Smith's message is never mentioned as it cannot be integrated into\
    \ modern theory: \"Wealth\" depends on the division of labour which changes with\
    \ market volume and on the proportion of productive to Unproductive labor."
  question: When was Wealth of Nations written?
- answer: Albertus Magnus
  context: "An early formal system of temporal logic was studied by Avicenna. Although\
    \ he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the\
    \ relationship between temporalis and the implication. Avicenna's work was further\
    \ developed by Najm al-D\u012Bn al-Qazw\u012Bn\u012B al-K\u0101tib\u012B and became\
    \ the dominant system of Islamic logic until modern times. Avicennian logic also\
    \ influenced several early European logicians such as Albertus Magnus and William\
    \ of Ockham. Avicenna endorsed the law of noncontradiction proposed by Aristotle,\
    \ that a fact could not be both true and false at the same time and in the same\
    \ sense of the terminology used. He stated, \"Anyone who denies the law of noncontradiction\
    \ should be beaten and burned until he admits that to be beaten is not the same\
    \ as not to be beaten, and to be burned is not the same as not to be burned.\""
  question: What European logician was greatly influenced by Avicenna?
- answer: National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad
  context: "In January 2012 a Tuareg rebellion began in Northern Mali, led by the\
    \ National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad. In March, military officer Amadou\
    \ Sanogo seized power in a coup d'\xE9tat, citing Tour\xE9's failures in quelling\
    \ the rebellion, and leading to sanctions and an embargo by the Economic Community\
    \ of West African States. The MNLA quickly took control of the north, declaring\
    \ independence as Azawad. However, Islamist groups including Ansar Dine and Al-Qaeda\
    \ in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), who had helped the MNLA defeat the government,\
    \ turned on the Tuareg and took control of the North with the goal of implementing\
    \ sharia in Mali."
  question: What group led the rebellion in Northern Mali?
- answer: The New York Islanders and the New York Rangers
  context: The New York Islanders and the New York Rangers represent the city in the
    National Hockey League. Also within the metropolitan area are the New Jersey Devils,
    who play in nearby Newark, New Jersey.
  question: There are two hockey teams located in NYC. What are they?
- answer: go and milk
  context: "Irir Samaale, the oldest common ancestor of several Somali clans, is generally\
    \ regarded as the source of the ethnonym Somali. The name \"Somali\" is, in turn,\
    \ held to be derived from the words soo and maal, which together mean \"go and\
    \ milk\" \u2014 a reference to the ubiquitous pastoralism of the Somali people.\
    \ Another plausible etymology proposes that the term Somali is derived from the\
    \ Arabic for \"wealthy\" (dhawamaal), again referring to Somali riches in livestock."
  question: What does 'soo and maal' mean in English?
- answer: '2011'
  context: Doug Morris, who was head of Warner Music Group, then Universal Music,
    became chairman and CEO of the company on July 1, 2011. Sony Music underwent a
    restructuring after Morris' arrival. He was joined by L.A. Reid, who became the
    chairman and CEO of Epic Records. Under Reid, multiple artists from the Jive half
    of the former RCA/Jive Label Group moved to Epic. Peter Edge became the new CEO
    of the RCA Records unit. The RCA Music Group closed down Arista, J Records and
    Jive Records in October 2011, with the artists from those labels being moved to
    RCA Records.
  question: In what year did he become the CEO of Sony Music?
- answer: 6th century BCE
  context: Many smaller clans mentioned within early literature seem to have been
    present across the rest of the subcontinent. Some of these kings were hereditary;
    other states elected their rulers. Early "republics" such as the Vajji (or Vriji)
    confederation centered in the city of Vaishali, existed as early as the 6th century
    BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century CE. The educated speech
    at that time was Sanskrit, while the languages of the general population of northern
    India are referred to as Prakrits. Many of the sixteen kingdoms had coalesced
    to four major ones by 500/400 BCE, by the time of Gautama Buddha. These four were
    Vatsa, Avanti, Kosala, and Magadha. The Life of Gautam Budhha was mainly associated
    with these four kingdoms.
  question: How early did the small republic states exist in India?
- answer: '"Tartarized Chinese" or "Tartarified Chinese"'
  context: "Banner Armies were organized along ethnic lines, namely Manchu and Mongol,\
    \ but included non-Manchu bondservants registered under the household of their\
    \ Manchu masters. The years leading up to the conquest increased the number of\
    \ Han Chinese under Manchu rule, leading Hong Taiji to create the Eight Han Banners\
    \ (zh), and around the time of the Qing takeover of Beijing, their numbers rapidly\
    \ swelled. Han Bannermen held high status and power in the early Qing period,\
    \ especially immediately after the conquest during Shunzhi and Kangxi's reign\
    \ where they dominated Governor-Generalships and Governorships across China at\
    \ the expense of both Manchu Bannermen and Han civilians. Han also numerically\
    \ dominated the Banners up until the mid 18th century. European visitors in Beijing\
    \ called them \"Tartarized Chinese\" or \"Tartarified Chinese\". It was in Qianlong's\
    \ reign that the Qianlong Emperor, concerned about maintaining Manchu identity,\
    \ re-emphasized Manchu ethnicity, ancestry, language, and culture in the Eight\
    \ Banners and started a mass discharge of Han Bannermen from the Eight Banners,\
    \ either asking them to voluntarily resign from the Banner rolls or striking their\
    \ names off. This led to a change from Han majority to a Manchu majority within\
    \ the Banner system, and previous Han Bannermen garrisons in southern China such\
    \ as at Fuzhou, Zhenjiang, Guangzhou, were replaced by Manchu Bannermen in the\
    \ purge, which started in 1754. The turnover by Qianlong most heavily impacted\
    \ Han banner garrisons stationed in the provinces while it less impacted Han Bannermen\
    \ in Beijing, leaving a larger proportion of remaining Han Bannermen in Beijing\
    \ than the provinces. Han Bannermen's status was decreased from that point on\
    \ with Manchu Banners gaining higher status. Han Bannermen numbered 75% in 1648\
    \ Shunzhi's reign, 72% in 1723 Yongzheng's reign, but decreased to 43% in 1796\
    \ during the first year of Jiaqing's reign, which was after Qianlong's purge.\
    \ The mass discharge was known as the Disbandment of the Han Banners (zh). Qianlong\
    \ directed most of his ire at those Han Bannermen descended from defectors who\
    \ joined the Qing after the Qing passed through the Great Wall at Shanhai Pass\
    \ in 1644, deeming their ancestors as traitors to the Ming and therefore untrustworthy,\
    \ while retaining Han Bannermen who were descended from defectors who joined the\
    \ Qing before 1644 in Liaodong and marched through Shanhai pass, also known as\
    \ those who \"followed the Dragon through the pass\" (\u5F9E\u9F8D\u5165\u95DC\
    ; cong long ru guan)."
  question: What did the Europeans call Han Bannermen?
- answer: The pigeon family
  context: Most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water
    run down the throat. Some species, especially of arid zones, belonging to the
    pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking
    up water without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on
    water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations
    at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young
    by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest
    in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos
    and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that
    they provide to their chicks.
  question: What is one family of birds have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid
    to their chicks?
- answer: Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector
  context: With the redevelopment of Las Vegas and the opening of two casinos in Connecticut
    in the early 1990s, along with newly built casinos in the nearby Philadelphia
    metro area in the 2000s, Atlantic City's tourism began to decline due to its failure
    to diversify away from gaming. Determined to expand, in 1999 the Atlantic City
    Redevelopment Authority partnered with Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn to develop
    a new roadway to a barren section of the city near the Marina. Nicknamed "The
    Tunnel Project", Steve Wynn planned the proposed 'Mirage Atlantic City' around
    the idea that he would connect the $330 million tunnel stretching 2.5 miles (4.0
    km) from the Atlantic City Expressway to his new resort. The roadway was later
    officially named the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, and funnels incoming
    traffic off of the expressway into the city's marina district and Brigantine,
    New Jersey.
  question: '"The Tunnel Project" was later officially named what?'
- answer: in 1264 or shortly before
  context: 'Dante Alighieri''s Divine Comedy, derived features of and episodes about
    Bolgia from Arabic works on Islamic eschatology: the Hadith and the Kitab al-Miraj
    (translated into Latin in 1264 or shortly before as Liber Scale Machometi) concerning
    the ascension to Heaven of Muhammad, and the spiritual writings of Ibn Arabi.
    The Moors also had a noticeable influence on the works of George Peele and William
    Shakespeare. Some of their works featured Moorish characters, such as Peele''s
    The Battle of Alcazar and Shakespeare''s The Merchant of Venice, Titus Andronicus
    and Othello, which featured a Moorish Othello as its title character. These works
    are said to have been inspired by several Moorish delegations from Morocco to
    Elizabethan England at the beginning of the 17th century.'
  question: In what year was Kitab al-Miraj likely translated into Latin?
- answer: increasingly prolonged dry periods during the summer months
  context: Due to many centuries of intensive settlement, most of the area is shaped
    by human influence. The original natural vegetation of Thuringia is forest with
    beech as its predominant species, as can still be found in the Hainich mountains
    today. In the uplands, a mixture of beech and spruce would be natural. However,
    most of the plains have been cleared and are in intensive agricultural use while
    most of the forests are planted with spruce and pine. Since 1990, Thuringia's
    forests have been managed aiming for a more natural and tough vegetation more
    resilient to climate change as well as diseases and vermin. In comparison to the
    forest, agriculture is still quite conventional and dominated by large structures
    and monocultures. Problems here are caused especially by increasingly prolonged
    dry periods during the summer months.
  question: Where do most landscape problems come from?
- answer: gaelic football
  context: "Hurling and football are the most popular spectator sports in the city.\
    \ Hurling has a strong identity with city and county \u2013 with Cork winning\
    \ 30 All-Ireland Championships. Gaelic football is also popular, and Cork has\
    \ won 7 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship titles. There are many Gaelic\
    \ Athletic Association clubs in Cork City, including Blackrock National Hurling\
    \ Club, St. Finbarr's, Glen Rovers, Na Piarsaigh and Nemo Rangers. The main public\
    \ venues are P\xE1irc U\xED Chaoimh and P\xE1irc U\xED Rinn (named after the noted\
    \ Glen Rovers player Christy Ring). Camogie (hurling for ladies) and women's gaelic\
    \ football are increasing in popularity."
  question: What sport has been gaining steam as more and more women play?
- answer: UN forces
  context: "Meanwhile, U.S. garrisons in Japan continually dispatched soldiers and\
    \ mat\xE9riel to reinforce defenders in the Pusan Perimeter. Tank battalions deployed\
    \ to Korea directly from the U.S. mainland from the port of San Francisco to the\
    \ port of Pusan, the largest Korean port. By late August, the Pusan Perimeter\
    \ had some 500 medium tanks battle-ready. In early September 1950, ROK Army and\
    \ UN Command forces outnumbered the KPA 180,000 to 100,000 soldiers. The UN forces,\
    \ once prepared, counterattacked and broke out of the Pusan Perimeter."
  question: Who was able to counterattack and move the KPA away from the Pusan Perimeter?
- answer: Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011
  context: "Starting with Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1925, and continued through\
    \ the Democrats' control of the House from 1931 to 1995, save for Republican majorities\
    \ in 1947\u201349 and 1953\u201355, all majority leaders have directly ascended\
    \ to the Speakership brought upon by the retirement of the incumbent. The only\
    \ exceptions during this period were Charles A. Halleck who became Republican\
    \ House leader and Minority Leader from 1959 to 1965, Hale Boggs who died in a\
    \ plane crash, and Dick Gephardt who became the Democrats' House leader but as\
    \ Minority Leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections.\
    \ Since 1995, the only Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner, though\
    \ indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections. He subsequently\
    \ served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and\
    \ then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011. In 1998, with Speaker\
    \ Newt Gingrich announcing his resignation, both Majority Leader Dick Armey and\
    \ Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not contest the Speakership which eventually went\
    \ to Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert."
  question: Between majority leader and speaker what roles did Boehner have?
- answer: easy-to-use, low-cost
  context: The Macintosh project was begun in 1979 by Jef Raskin, an Apple employee
    who envisioned an easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer. He
    wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh, but
    the spelling was changed to "Macintosh" for legal reasons as the original was
    the same spelling as that used by McIntosh Laboratory, Inc., the audio equipment
    manufacturer. Steve Jobs requested that McIntosh Laboratory give Apple a release
    for the name with its changed spelling so that Apple could use it, but the request
    was denied, forcing Apple to eventually buy the rights to use the name. (A 1984
    Byte Magazine article suggested Apple changed the spelling only after "early users"
    misspelled "McIntosh". However, Jef Raskin had adopted the Macintosh spelling
    by 1981, when the Macintosh computer was still a single prototype machine in the
    lab. This explanation further clashes with the first explanation given above that
    the change was made for "legal reasons.")
  question: What did Jef Raskin envision for a computer to be for an average consumer?
- answer: south
  context: The landing was north of Sevastopol, so the Russians had arrayed their
    army in expectation of a direct attack. The allies advanced and on the morning
    of 20 September came up to the Alma river and the whole Russian army. The position
    was strong, but after three hours,:424 the frontal attack had driven the Russians
    out of their dug in positions with losses of 6000 men. The Battle of the Alma
    had 3,300 Allied losses. Failing to pursue the retreating forces was one of many
    strategic errors made during the war, and the Russians themselves noted that had
    they pressed south that day they would have easily captured Sevastopol.
  question: Which way did the Russians believe they should have traveled?
- answer: January 19, 2011
  context: "Season ten of the series premiered on January 19, 2011. Many changes were\
    \ introduced this season, from the format to the personnel of the show. Jennifer\
    \ Lopez and Steven Tyler joined Randy Jackson as judges following the departures\
    \ of Simon Cowell (who left to launch the U.S. version of The X Factor), Kara\
    \ DioGuardi (whose contract was not renewed) and Ellen DeGeneres, while Nigel\
    \ Lythgoe returned as executive producer. Jimmy Iovine, chairman of the Interscope\
    \ Geffen A&M label group, the new partner of American Idol, acted as the in-house\
    \ mentor in place of weekly guest mentors, although in later episodes special\
    \ guest mentors such as Beyonc\xE9, will.i.am and Lady Gaga were brought in."
  question: When did season ten premiere?
- answer: 'no'
  context: "Note that the Polish landed gentry (ziemianie or ziemia\u0144stwo) was\
    \ composed of any nobility that owned lands: thus of course the magnates, the\
    \ middle nobility and that lesser nobility that had at least part of the village.\
    \ As manorial lordships were also opened to burgesses of certain privileged royal\
    \ cities, not all landed gentry had a hereditary title of nobility."
  question: Did all hold title of nobility?
- answer: treason
  context: After HMS Sheffield was wrecked by an Argentinian attack, The Sun was heavily
    criticised and even mocked for its coverage of the war in The Daily Mirror and
    The Guardian, and the wider media queried the veracity of official information
    and worried about the number of casualties, The Sun gave its response. "There
    are traitors in our midst", wrote leader writer Ronald Spark on 7 May, accusing
    commentators on Daily Mirror and The Guardian, plus the BBC's defence correspondent
    Peter Snow, of "treason" for aspects of their coverage.
  question: What was the accusation leveled by Ronald Spark against The Daily Mirror,
    The Guardian, and BBC?
- answer: Palladian
  context: Versions of revived Palladian architecture dominated English country house
    architecture. Houses were increasingly placed in grand landscaped settings, and
    large houses were generally made wide and relatively shallow, largely to look
    more impressive from a distance. The height was usually highest in the centre,
    and the Baroque emphasis on corner pavilions often found on the continent generally
    avoided. In grand houses, an entrance hall led to steps up to a piano nobile or
    mezzanine floor where the main reception rooms were. Typically the basement area
    or "rustic", with kitchens, offices and service areas, as well as male guests
    with muddy boots, came some way above ground, and was lit by windows that were
    high on the inside, but just above ground level outside. A single block was typical,
    with a perhaps a small court for carriages at the front marked off by railings
    and a gate, but rarely a stone gatehouse, or side wings around the court.
  question: What revived style dominated English country house architecture?
- answer: 3.3%
  context: According to the 2010 revison of the UN World Population Prospects, Guinea-Bissau's
    population was 1,515,000 in 2010, compared to 518,000 in 1950. The proportion
    of the population below the age of 15 in 2010 was 41.3%, 55.4% were aged between
    15 and 65 years of age, while 3.3% were aged 65 years or older.
  question: What percentage of the population was 65 or older?
- answer: Carolingian Empire
  context: "In the fifth century Strasbourg was occupied successively by Alemanni,\
    \ Huns, and Franks. In the ninth century it was commonly known as Strazburg in\
    \ the local language, as documented in 842 by the Oaths of Strasbourg. This trilingual\
    \ text contains, alongside texts in Latin and Old High German (teudisca lingua),\
    \ the oldest written variety of Gallo-Romance (lingua romana) clearly distinct\
    \ from Latin, the ancestor of Old French. The town was also called Stratisburgum\
    \ or Strateburgus in Latin, from which later came Strossburi in Alsatian and Stra\xDF\
    burg in Standard German, and then Strasbourg in French. The Oaths of Strasbourg\
    \ is considered as marking the birth of the two countries of France and Germany\
    \ with the division of the Carolingian Empire."
  question: What Empire split to create France and Germany?
- answer: Giacomo Leoni
  context: "Georgian succeeded the English Baroque of Sir Christopher Wren, Sir John\
    \ Vanbrugh, Thomas Archer, William Talman, and Nicholas Hawksmoor; this in fact\
    \ continued into at least the 1720s, overlapping with a more restrained Georgian\
    \ style. The architect James Gibbs was a transitional figure, his earlier buildings\
    \ are Baroque, reflecting the time he spent in Rome in the early 18th century,\
    \ but he adjusted his style after 1720. Major architects to promote the change\
    \ in direction from baroque were Colen Campbell, author of the influential book\
    \ Vitruvius Britannicus (1715-1725); Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington and\
    \ his prot\xE9g\xE9 William Kent; Isaac Ware; Henry Flitcroft and the Venetian\
    \ Giacomo Leoni, who spent most of his career in England. Other prominent architects\
    \ of the early Georgian period include James Paine, Robert Taylor, and John Wood,\
    \ the Elder. The European Grand Tour became very common for wealthy patrons in\
    \ the period, and Italian influence remained dominant, though at the start of\
    \ the period Hanover Square, Westminster (1713 on), developed and occupied by\
    \ Whig supporters of the new dynasty, seems to have deliberately adopted German\
    \ stylisic elements in their honour, especially vertical bands connecting the\
    \ windows."
  question: What Venetian spent most of his career in England?
- answer: English
  context: "In English, the term referring to a person first appears in the mid 14th\
    \ century as Catelaner, followed in the 15th century as Catellain (from French).\
    \ It is attested a language name since at least 1652. Catalan can be pronounced\
    \ as /\u02C8k\xE6t\u0259l\xE6n/, /k\xE6t\u0259\u02C8l\xE6n/ or /\u02C8k\xE6t\u0259\

  question: What is the language source of the term Catelaner?
- answer: Lord of Mann
  context: 'Elizabeth has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout
    the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders in her own countries, and has received
    honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms she has a distinct
    title that follows a similar formula: Queen of Jamaica and her other realms and
    territories in Jamaica, Queen of Australia and her other realms and territories
    in Australia, etc. In the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies
    rather than separate realms, she is known as Duke of Normandy and Lord of Mann,
    respectively. Additional styles include Defender of the Faith and Duke of Lancaster.
    When in conversation with the Queen, the practice is to initially address her
    as Your Majesty and thereafter as Ma''am.'
  question: What is Elizabeth's title on the Isle of Mann?
- answer: heavy metal
  context: "Queen have been recognised as having made significant contributions to\
    \ such genres as hard rock, and heavy metal, among others. Hence, the band have\
    \ been cited as an influence by many other musicians. Moreover, like their music,\
    \ the bands and artists that have claimed to be influenced by Queen and have expressed\

    \ Michael, Robbie Williams, Adele, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry."
  question: Several groups from which type of metal were influenced by Queen?
- answer: inadequate regulation
  context: The World Health Organization and the UN Environment Programme estimate
    that each year, 3 million workers in agriculture in the developing world experience
    severe poisoning from pesticides, about 18,000 of whom die. Owing to inadequate
    regulation and safety precautions, 99% of pesticide related deaths occur in developing
    countries that account for only 25% of pesticide usage. According to one study,
    as many as 25 million workers in developing countries may suffer mild pesticide
    poisoning yearly. There are several careers aside from agriculture that may also
    put individuals at risk of health effects from pesticide exposure including pet
    groomers, groundskeepers, and fumigators.
  question: Why are 99% of pesticide related deaths in underdeveloped countries?
- answer: Azores and Madeira
  context: "Portugal (Portuguese: [pu\u027Etu\u02C8\u0263a\u026B]), officially the\
    \ Portuguese Republic (Portuguese: Rep\xFAblica Portuguesa), is a country on the\
    \ Iberian Peninsula, in Southwestern Europe. It is the westernmost country of\
    \ mainland Europe, being bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south\
    \ and by Spain to the north and east. The Portugal\u2013Spain border is 1,214\
    \ km (754 mi) long and considered the longest uninterrupted border within the\
    \ European Union. The republic also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the\
    \ Azores and Madeira, both autonomous regions with their own regional governments."
  question: What two autonomous regions have their own governments in Portugal?
- answer: Persian
  context: "Ibn S\u012Bn\u0101 wrote extensively on early Islamic philosophy, especially\
    \ the subjects logic, ethics, and metaphysics, including treatises named Logic\
    \ and Metaphysics. Most of his works were written in Arabic \u2013 then the language\
    \ of science in the Middle East \u2013 and some in Persian. Of linguistic significance\
    \ even to this day are a few books that he wrote in nearly pure Persian language\
    \ (particularly the Danishnamah-yi 'Ala', Philosophy for Ala' ad-Dawla'). Ibn\
    \ S\u012Bn\u0101's commentaries on Aristotle often criticized the philosopher,[citation\
    \ needed] encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of ijtihad."
  question: Ibn Sina also wrote some of his works in what other language?
- answer: 1980s
  context: The service's B-2A aircraft entered service in the 1990s, its B-1B aircraft
    in the 1980s and its current B-52H aircraft in the early 1960s. The B-52 Stratofortress
    airframe design is over 60 years old and the B-52H aircraft currently in the active
    inventory were all built between 1960 and 1962. The B-52H is scheduled to remain
    in service for another 30 years, which would keep the airframe in service for
    nearly 90 years, an unprecedented length of service for any aircraft. The B-21
    is projected to replace the B-52 and parts of the B-1B force by the mid-2020s.
  question: When did the USAF introduce the B-1B aircraft?
- answer: The Norfuk language
  context: 'Islanders speak both English and a creole language known as Norfuk, a
    blend of 18th-century English and Tahitian. The Norfuk language is decreasing
    in popularity as more tourists travel to the island and more young people leave
    for work and study reasons; however, there are efforts to keep it alive via dictionaries
    and the renaming of some tourist attractions to their Norfuk equivalents. In 2004
    an act of the Norfolk Island Assembly made it a co-official language of the island.
    The act is long-titled: "An Act to recognise the Norfolk Island Language (Norf''k)
    as an official language of Norfolk Island." The "language known as ''Norf''k''"
    is described as the language "that is spoken by descendants of the first free
    settlers of Norfolk Island who were descendants of the settlers of Pitcairn Island".
    The act recognises and protects use of the language but does not require it; in
    official use, it must be accompanied by an accurate translation into English.
    32% of the total population reported speaking a language other than English in
    the 2011 census, and just under three-quarters of the ordinarily resident population
    could speak Norfuk.'
  question: What is the official co-language of Norfolk Island?
- answer: miliary tuberculosis
  context: "In 15\u201320% of active cases, the infection spreads outside the lungs,\
    \ causing other kinds of TB. These are collectively denoted as \"extrapulmonary\
    \ tuberculosis\". Extrapulmonary TB occurs more commonly in immunosuppressed persons\
    \ and young children. In those with HIV, this occurs in more than 50% of cases.\
    \ Notable extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura (in tuberculous pleurisy),\
    \ the central nervous system (in tuberculous meningitis), the lymphatic system\
    \ (in scrofula of the neck), the genitourinary system (in urogenital tuberculosis),\
    \ and the bones and joints (in Pott disease of the spine), among others. When\
    \ it spreads to the bones, it is also known as \"osseous tuberculosis\", a form\
    \ of osteomyelitis. Sometimes, bursting of a tubercular abscess through skin results\
    \ in tuberculous ulcer. An ulcer originating from nearby infected lymph nodes\
    \ is painless, slowly enlarging and has an appearance of \"wash leather\". A potentially\
    \ more serious, widespread form of TB is called \"disseminated tuberculosis\"\
    , also known as miliary tuberculosis. Miliary TB makes up about 10% of extrapulmonary\
    \ cases."
  question: What's the other name for "disseminated tuberculosis"?
- answer: disciplina Etrusca
  context: The exta were the entrails of a sacrificed animal, comprising in Cicero's
    enumeration the gall bladder (fel), liver (iecur), heart (cor), and lungs (pulmones).
    The exta were exposed for litatio (divine approval) as part of Roman liturgy,
    but were "read" in the context of the disciplina Etrusca. As a product of Roman
    sacrifice, the exta and blood are reserved for the gods, while the meat (viscera)
    is shared among human beings in a communal meal. The exta of bovine victims were
    usually stewed in a pot (olla or aula), while those of sheep or pigs were grilled
    on skewers. When the deity's portion was cooked, it was sprinkled with mola salsa
    (ritually prepared salted flour) and wine, then placed in the fire on the altar
    for the offering; the technical verb for this action was porricere.
  question: How were the exta read in Roman religious practice?
- answer: Democratic Party and the Republican Party
  context: While there is some international commonality in the way political parties
    are recognized, and in how they operate, there are often many differences, and
    some are significant. Many political parties have an ideological core, but some
    do not, and many represent very different ideologies than they did when first
    founded. In democracies, political parties are elected by the electorate to run
    a government. Many countries have numerous powerful political parties, such as
    Germany and India and some nations have one-party systems, such as China. The
    United States is a two-party system, with its two most powerful parties being
    the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.
  question: What are the two most powerful political parties in the United States?
- answer: European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association part numbering scheme
  context: 'The Pro Electron standard, the European Electronic Component Manufacturers
    Association part numbering scheme, begins with two letters: the first gives the
    semiconductor type (A for germanium, B for silicon, and C for materials like GaAs);
    the second letter denotes the intended use (A for diode, C for general-purpose
    transistor, etc.). A 3-digit sequence number (or one letter then 2 digits, for
    industrial types) follows. With early devices this indicated the case type. Suffixes
    may be used, with a letter (e.g. "C" often means high hFE, such as in: BC549C)
    or other codes may follow to show gain (e.g. BC327-25) or voltage rating (e.g.
    BUK854-800A). The more common prefixes are:'
  question: What is the Pro Electron standard?
- answer: do not
  context: The bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane (also known as a lipid,
    cytoplasmic or plasma membrane). This membrane encloses the contents of the cell
    and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients, proteins and other essential components
    of the cytoplasm within the cell. As they are prokaryotes, bacteria do not usually
    have membrane-bound organelles in their cytoplasm, and thus contain few large
    intracellular structures. They lack a true nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts
    and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells. Bacteria were once seen
    as simple bags of cytoplasm, but structures such as the prokaryotic cytoskeleton
    and the localization of proteins to specific locations within the cytoplasm that
    give bacteria some complexity have been discovered. These subcellular levels of
    organization have been called "bacterial hyperstructures".
  question: Do bacteria have membrabe-bound organelles in their cytoplasm?
- answer: two minutes
  context: "The playing time of a phonograph record depended on the turntable speed\
    \ and the groove spacing. At the beginning of the 20th century, the early discs\
    \ played for two minutes, the same as early cylinder records. The 12-inch disc,\
    \ introduced by Victor in 1903, increased the playing time to three and a half\
    \ minutes. Because a 10-inch 78 rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound\
    \ per side and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music, almost\
    \ all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. For example,\
    \ when King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, including Louis Armstrong on his first\
    \ recordings, recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, in 1923,\
    \ one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52\u20132:59."
  question: What was the playing time common in the early 20th century?
- answer: Pedialyte
  context: Oral rehydration solution (ORS) (a slightly sweetened and salty water)
    can be used to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice
    water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given.
    Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green
    coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can
    have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three
    grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given.
    There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as
    UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians
    recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt
    (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added (approximately the "taste
    of tears"). Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but
    only one-half a teaspoon of salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less
    risky with very little loss of effectiveness. Both agree that drinks with too
    much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse.
  question: What is a commercial solution that can also be used?
- answer: Saad Zaghlul
  context: "The new government drafted and implemented a constitution in 1923 based\
    \ on a parliamentary system. Saad Zaghlul was popularly elected as Prime Minister\
    \ of Egypt in 1924. In 1936, the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded. Continued\
    \ instability due to remaining British influence and increasing political involvement\
    \ by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d'\xE9\
    tat known as the 1952 Revolution. The Free Officers Movement forced King Farouk\
    \ to abdicate in support of his son Fuad. British military presence in Egypt lasted\
    \ until 1954."
  question: Who was elected in 1924?
- answer: teachers and their textbooks
  context: Some claim that there is education inequality because children did not
    exceed the education of their parents. This education inequality is then associated
    with income inequality. Although critical thinking is a goal of education, criticism
    and blame are often the unintended by products of our current educational process.
    Students often blame their teachers and their textbooks, despite the availability
    of libraries and the internet. When someone tries to improve education, the educational
    establishment itself occasionally showers the person with criticism rather than
    gratitude. Better by products of an educational system would be gratitude and
    determination.
  question: Who do students often blame for their education short comings?
- answer: a heavy stone
  context: Traditional sports include Swiss wrestling or "Schwingen". It is an old
    tradition from the rural central cantons and considered the national sport by
    some. Hornussen is another indigenous Swiss sport, which is like a cross between
    baseball and golf. Steinstossen is the Swiss variant of stone put, a competition
    in throwing a heavy stone. Practiced only among the alpine population since prehistoric
    times, it is recorded to have taken place in Basel in the 13th century. It is
    also central to the Unspunnenfest, first held in 1805, with its symbol the 83.5
    kg stone named Unspunnenstein.
  question: What is thrown in the Swiss competition Steinstossen?
- answer: Hospital of Saint Raphael
  context: "The New Haven area supports several medical facilities that are considered\
    \ some of the best hospitals in the country. There are two major medical centers\
    \ downtown: Yale \u2013 New Haven Hospital has four pavilions, including the Yale\
    \ \u2013 New Haven Children's Hospital and the Smilow Cancer Hospital; the Hospital\
    \ of Saint Raphael is several blocks north, and touts its excellent cardiac emergency\
    \ care program. Smaller downtown health facilities are the Temple Medical Center\
    \ located downtown on Temple Street, Connecticut Mental Health Center/ across\
    \ Park Street from Y-NHH, and the Hill Health Center, which serves the working-class\
    \ Hill neighborhood. A large Veterans Affairs hospital is located in neighboring\
    \ West Haven. To the west in Milford is Milford Hospital, and to the north in\
    \ Meriden is the MidState Medical Center."
  question: What hospital in New Haven provides notable cardiac emergency care?
- answer: Hardware database accelerators
  context: Physically, database servers are dedicated computers that hold the actual
    databases and run only the DBMS and related software. Database servers are usually
    multiprocessor computers, with generous memory and RAID disk arrays used for stable
    storage. RAID is used for recovery of data if any of the disks fail. Hardware
    database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel,
    are also used in large volume transaction processing environments. DBMSs are found
    at the heart of most database applications. DBMSs may be built around a custom
    multitasking kernel with built-in networking support, but modern DBMSs typically
    rely on a standard operating system to provide these functions. from databases
    before the inception of Structured Query Language (SQL). The data recovered was
    disparate, redundant and disorderly, since there was no proper method to fetch
    it and arrange it in a concrete structure.[citation needed]
  question: How can large quantities of data be accessed?
- answer: NASA
  context: KU's School of Business launched interdisciplinary management science graduate
    studies in operations research during Fall Semester 1965. The program provided
    the foundation for decision science applications supporting NASA Project Apollo
    Command Capsule Recovery Operations.
  question: Which government agency used the applications that were informed by KU's
    interdisciplinary management program?
- answer: Japan
  context: "On 24 August, Pravda and Izvestia carried news of the non-secret portions\
    \ of the Pact, complete with the now infamous front-page picture of Molotov signing\
    \ the treaty, with a smiling Stalin looking on. The news was met with utter shock\
    \ and surprise by government leaders and media worldwide, most of whom were aware\
    \ only of the British\u2013French\u2013Soviet negotiations that had taken place\
    \ for months. The Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact was received with shock by Nazi\
    \ Germany's allies, notably Japan, by the Comintern and foreign communist parties,\
    \ and by Jewish communities all around the world. So, that day, German diplomat\
    \ Hans von Herwarth, whose grandmother was Jewish, informed Guido Relli, an Italian\
    \ diplomat, and American charg\xE9 d'affaires Charles Bohlen on the secret protocol\
    \ regarding vital interests in the countries' allotted \"spheres of influence\"\
    , without revealing the annexation rights for \"territorial and political rearrangement\"\
    ."
  question: Which ally of Germany was most surprised by the signing of the agreement?
- answer: True Blue (1986) and Like a Prayer (1989)
  context: Her mature artistic statement was visible in True Blue (1986) and Like
    a Prayer (1989). In True Blue, she incorporated classical music in order to engage
    an older audience who had been skeptical of her music. Like a Prayer introduced
    live recorded songs and incorporated different genres of music, including dance,
    funk, R&B and gospel music. Her versatility was further shown on I'm Breathless,
    which consists predominantly of the 1940s Broadway showtune-flavoured jazz, swing
    and big band tracks. Madonna continued to compose ballads and uptempo dance songs
    for Erotica (1992) and Bedtime Stories (1994). Both albums explored element of
    new jack swing, with Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly saying that "she could
    actually be viewed as new jack swing's godmother." She tried to remain contemporary
    by incorporating samples, drum loops and hip hop into her music. With Ray of Light,
    Madonna brought electronic music from its underground status into massive popularity
    in mainstream music scene.
  question: Which 2 album show Madonna's artistic statement?
- answer: Saint Joachim and Saint Anne
  context: The doctrine of the immaculate conception (Mary being conceived free from
    original sin) is not to be confused with her virginal conception of her son Jesus.
    This misunderstanding of the term immaculate conception is frequently met in the
    mass media. Catholics believe that Mary was not the product of a virginal conception
    herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother, traditionally known
    by the names of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne. In 1677, the Holy See condemned
    the belief that Mary was virginally conceived, which had been a belief surfacing
    occasionally since the 4th century. The Church celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate
    Conception (when Mary was conceived free from original sin) on 8 December, exactly
    nine months before celebrating the Nativity of Mary. The feast of the Annunciation
    (which commemorates the virginal conception and the Incarnation of Jesus) is celebrated
    on 25 March, nine months before Christmas Day.
  question: Who were the parents of Mary believed to be ?
- answer: 12%
  context: Christianity is the predominant religion of Switzerland (about 71% of resident
    population and 75% of Swiss citizens), divided between the Catholic Church (38.21%
    of the population), the Swiss Reformed Church (26.93%), further Protestant churches
    (2.89%) and other Christian denominations (2.79%). There has been a recent rise
    in Evangelicalism. Immigration has brought Islam (4.95%) and Eastern Orthodoxy
    (around 2%) as sizeable minority religions. According to a 2015 poll by Gallup
    International, 12% of Swiss people self-identified as "convinced atheists."
  question: According to a 2015 Gallup Poll, what percentage of Swiss people are convinced
    atheists?
- answer: thiamine
  context: In the early 1880s, Kanehiro Takaki observed that Japanese sailors (whose
    diets consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed beriberi (or endemic
    neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors
    and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats
    to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease, (not because of the increased
    protein as Takaki supposed but because it introduced a few parts per million of
    thiamine to the diet, later understood as a cure).
  question: What was introduced to the diet on a molecular level that prevented the
    sailors from contracting the disease?
- answer: Sam Mendes
  context: Spectre (2015) is the twenty-fourth James Bond film produced by Eon Productions.
    It features Daniel Craig in his fourth performance as James Bond, and Christoph
    Waltz as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, with the film marking the character's re-introduction
    into the series. It was directed by Sam Mendes as his second James Bond film following
    Skyfall, and was written by John Logan, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth.
    It is distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures. With a budget
    around $245 million, it is the most expensive Bond film and one of the most expensive
    films ever made.
  question: Who directed Spectre?
- answer: seal
  context: "The Shang dynasty oracle bone script and the Zhou dynasty scripts found\
    \ on Chinese bronze inscriptions are no longer used; the oldest script that is\
    \ still in use today is the Seal Script (\u7BC6\u66F8(\u4E66), zhu\xE0nsh\u016B\
    ). It evolved organically out of the Spring and Autumn period Zhou script, and\
    \ was adopted in a standardized form under the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi\
    \ Huang. The seal script, as the name suggests, is now used only in artistic seals.\
    \ Few people are still able to read it effortlessly today, although the art of\
    \ carving a traditional seal in the script remains alive; some calligraphers also\
    \ work in this style."
  question: What script is only used in artistic seals?
- answer: the Armed Forces Council.
  context: The Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Armed Forces is the reigning Canadian
    monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, who is represented by the Governor General of Canada.
    The Canadian Armed Forces is led by the Chief of the Defence Staff, who is advised
    and assisted by the Armed Forces Council.
  question: Who advises the Chief of the Defence?
- answer: chronic stomach trouble
  context: In March 1861, Victoria's mother died, with Victoria at her side. Through
    reading her mother's papers, Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her
    deeply; she was heart-broken, and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for "wickedly" estranging
    her from her mother. To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief, Albert
    took on most of her duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble.
    In August, Victoria and Albert visited their son, the Prince of Wales, who was
    attending army manoeuvres near Dublin, and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney.
    In November, Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress
    in Ireland. Appalled, Albert travelled to Cambridge, where his son was studying,
    to confront him. By the beginning of December, Albert was very unwell. He was
    diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner, and died on 14 December 1861.
    Victoria was devastated. She blamed her husband's death on worry over the Prince
    of Wales's philandering. He had been "killed by that dreadful business", she said.
    She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life.
    She avoided public appearances, and rarely set foot in London in the following
    years. Her seclusion earned her the nickname "widow of Windsor".
  question: What was Albert ill with?
- answer: the life of the gods
  context: "It has been pointed out that Khmer and Indonesian classical arts were\
    \ concerned with depicting the life of the gods, but to the Southeast Asian mind\
    \ the life of the gods was the life of the peoples themselves\u2014joyous, earthy,\
    \ yet divine. The Tai, coming late into Southeast Asia, brought with them some\
    \ Chinese artistic traditions, but they soon shed them in favour of the Khmer\
    \ and Mon traditions, and the only indications of their earlier contact with Chinese\
    \ arts were in the style of their temples, especially the tapering roof, and in\
    \ their lacquerware."
  question: What did the Khmer & Indonesian classical arts depict of?
- answer: the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers
  context: Punjab's geography mostly consists of the alluvial plain of the Indus River
    and its four major tributaries in Pakistan, the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej
    rivers. There are several mountainous regions, including the Sulaiman Mountains
    in the southwest part of the province, and Margalla Hills, Salt Range, and Pothohar
    Plateau in the north. Agriculture is the chief source of income and employment
    in Punjab; wheat and cotton are the principal crops. Since independence, Punjab
    has become the seat of political and economic power; it remains the most industrialised
    province of Pakistan. It counts for 39.2% of large scale manufacturing and 70%
    of small scale manufacturing in the country. Its capital Lahore is a major regional
    cultural, historical, and economic centre.
  question: What are the Indus River's tributaries?
- answer: materialism
  context: An argument for idealism, such as those of Hegel and Berkeley, is ipso
    facto an argument against materialism. Matter can be argued to be redundant, as
    in bundle theory, and mind-independent properties can in turn be reduced to subjective
    percepts. Berkeley presents an example of the latter by pointing out that it is
    impossible to gather direct evidence of matter, as there is no direct experience
    of matter; all that is experienced is perception, whether internal or external.
    As such, the existence of matter can only be assumed from the apparent (perceived)
    stability of perceptions; it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience.
  question: If you believe in idealism, you are disbeliving in what?
- answer: 121 stations
  context: The city also boasts an efficient network of public transportation, which
    mainly consists of bus, taxi and metro systems. The bus network, which is currently
    run by three companies since 2011, provides more than 370 routes covering all
    parts of the city and suburban areas. Nanjing Metro Line 1, started service on
    September 3, 2005, with 16 stations and a length of 21.72 km. Line 2 and the 24.5
    km-long south extension of Line 1 officially opened to passenger service on May
    28, 2010. At present, Nanjing has a metro system with a grand total of 223.6 kilometers
    (138.9 mi) of route and 121 stations. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 10,
    Line S1 and Line S8. The city is planning to complete a 17-line Metro and light-rail
    system by 2030. The expansion of the Metro network will greatly facilitate the
    intracity transportation and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion.
  question: How many stations are there in total in the Nanjing metro system?
- answer: '1988'
  context: The Israeli Space Agency coordinates all Israeli space research programs
    with scientific and commercial goals. In 2012 Israel was ranked ninth in the world
    by the Futron's Space Competitiveness Index. Israel is one of only seven countries
    that both build their own satellites and launch their own launchers. The Shavit
    is a space launch vehicle produced by Israel to launch small satellites into low
    earth orbit. It was first launched in 1988, making Israel the eighth nation to
    have a space launch capability. Shavit rockets are launched from the spaceport
    at the Palmachim Airbase by the Israeli Space Agency. Since 1988 Israel Aerospace
    Industries have indigenously designed and built at least 13 commercial, research
    and spy satellites. Some of Israel's satellites are ranked among the world's most
    advanced space systems. In 2003, Ilan Ramon became Israel's first astronaut, serving
    as payload specialist of STS-107, the fatal mission of the Space Shuttle Columbia.
  question: When did Israel launch it's first satellite?
- answer: $10 million
  context: Twins (1988), a comedy with Danny DeVito, also proved successful. Total
    Recall (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10 million and 15% of the film's gross. A
    science fiction script, the film was based on the Philip K. Dick short story "We
    Can Remember It for You Wholesale". Kindergarten Cop (1990) reunited him with
    director Ivan Reitman, who directed him in Twins. Schwarzenegger had a brief foray
    into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt,
    entitled "The Switch", and then with the 1992 telemovie Christmas in Connecticut.
    He has not directed since.
  question: How much did Schwarzenegger make from the film Total Recall, on top of
    15% of gross?
- answer: Atomic Energy Commission
  context: Among Ike's objectives in not directly confronting McCarthy was to prevent
    McCarthy from dragging the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) into McCarthy's witch
    hunt for communists, which would interfere with, and perhaps delay, the AEC's
    important work on H-bombs. The administration had discovered through its own investigations
    that one of the leading scientists on the AEC, J. Robert Oppenheimer, had urged
    that the H-bomb work be delayed. Eisenhower removed him from the agency and revoked
    his security clearance, though he knew this would create fertile ground for McCarthy.
  question: What organization did Eisenhower want to keep from being one of McCarthy's
    targets?
- answer: pediatric referral center
  context: Located in the Laurelhurst neighborhood, Seattle Children's, formerly Children's
    Hospital and Regional Medical Center, is the pediatric referral center for Washington,
    Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has a campus
    in the Eastlake neighborhood. The University District is home to the University
    of Washington Medical Center which, along with Harborview, is operated by the
    University of Washington. Seattle is also served by a Veterans Affairs hospital
    on Beacon Hill, a third campus of Swedish in Ballard, and Northwest Hospital and
    Medical Center near Northgate Mall.
  question: What kind of hospital is Seattle Children's?
- answer: January 1977
  context: In January 1977, Droney promoted him to First Assistant District Attorney,
    essentially making Kerry his campaign and media surrogate because Droney was afflicted
    with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's Disease). As First Assistant,
    Kerry tried cases, which included winning convictions in a high-profile rape case
    and a murder. He also played a role in administering the office, including initiating
    the creation of special white-collar and organized crime units, creating programs
    to address the problems of rape and other crime victims and witnesses, and managing
    trial calendars to reflect case priorities. It was in this role in 1978 that Kerry
    announced an investigation into possible criminal charges against then Senator
    Edward Brooke, regarding "misstatements" in his first divorce trial. The inquiry
    ended with no charges being brought after investigators and prosecutors determined
    that Brooke's misstatements were pertinent to the case, but were not material
    enough to have affected the outcome.
  question: When did Kerry become an ADA?
- answer: 11 June 1833
  context: "The process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June\
    \ 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator D\xE1maso Antonio Larra\xF1\
    aga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of\
    \ the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the\
    \ majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was\
    \ formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology\
    \ and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree establishing\
    \ the Greater University of the Republic. That decree had few practical effects,\
    \ given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay\
    \ at that time."
  question: When did the process of funding the country's public university begin?
- answer: Camp Bondsteel
  context: 'Albania has often been called the 51st state for its perceived strongly
    pro-American positions, mainly because of the United States'' policies towards
    it. In reference to President George W. Bush''s 2007 European tour, Edi Rama,
    Tirana''s mayor and leader of the opposition Socialists, said: "Albania is for
    sure the most pro-American country in Europe, maybe even in the world ... Nowhere
    else can you find such respect and hospitality for the President of the United
    States. Even in Michigan, he wouldn''t be as welcome." At the time of ex-Secretary
    of State James Baker''s visit in 1992, there was even a move to hold a referendum
    declaring the country as the 51st American state. In addition to Albania, Kosovo
    which is predominately Albanian is seen as a 51st state due to the heavily presence
    and influence of the United States. The US has had troops and the largest base
    outside US territory, Camp Bondsteel in the territory since 1999.'
  question: What is the name of the largest US military base outside of US territory?

  question: How many people marched on January 11 against terrorism?
- answer: an identity they can live with
  context: The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?]
    heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed]
    One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational
    settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or "dirty work"
    (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that "individuals gravitate toward
    and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they
    validate a "preferred organizational self" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some
    jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example
    of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of "glorified maids" (Tracy
    & Tretheway 2005). "The process by which people arrive at justifications of and
    values for various occupational choices." Among these are workplace satisfaction
    and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33). People in these types
    of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with.
    "Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work
    is considered "dirty" by societal standards" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 7). "In other
    words, doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel
    good in that job. "If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability
    of their work, and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming
    dirty work into a badge of honor, it is likely they will find blaming the client
    to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p.
    33).
  question: What are people in stigmatized jobs forced to create?
- answer: 10,700
  context: The Army (21,000 personnel) comprises three brigades and other small units.
    An infantry brigade (mainly equipped with Pandur II APC), a mechanized brigade
    (mainly equipped with Leopard 2 A6 tanks and M113 APC) and a Rapid Reaction Brigade
    (consisting of paratroopers, commandos and rangers). The Navy (10,700 personnel,
    of which 1,580 are marines) has five frigates, seven corvettes, two submarines,
    and 28 patrol and auxiliary vessels. The Air Force (7,500 personnel) has the Lockheed
    F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet as the main combat aircraft.
  question: How many personnel does the Navy have?
- answer: investor funds
  context: Economist Paul Krugman and U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner explain
    the credit crisis via the implosion of the shadow banking system, which had grown
    to nearly equal the importance of the traditional commercial banking sector as
    described above. Without the ability to obtain investor funds in exchange for
    most types of mortgage-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, investment
    banks and other entities in the shadow banking system could not provide funds
    to mortgage firms and other corporations.
  question: The shadow banking system could not provide funds to mortgage firms and
    other corporations without the ability to obtain which funds?
- answer: denied the claims
  context: Disagreements following the war have resulted in stalemate punctuated by
    periods of elevated tension and renewed threats of war. The stalemate led the
    President of Eritrea to urge the UN to take action on Ethiopia with the Eleven
    Letters penned by the President to the United Nations Security Council. The situation
    has been further escalated by the continued efforts of the Eritrean and Ethiopian
    leaders in supporting opposition in one another's countries.[citation needed]
    In 2011, Ethiopia accused Eritrea of planting bombs at an African Union summit
    in Addis Ababa, which was later supported by a UN report. Eritrea denied the claims.
  question: What did Eritrea do when it was accused of planting bombs at the African
    Union summit?
- answer: '1970'
  context: New Haven has a long tradition of urban planning and a purposeful design
    for the city's layout. The city could be argued to have some of the first preconceived
    layouts in the country. Upon founding, New Haven was laid out in a grid plan of
    nine square blocks; the central square was left open, in the tradition of many
    New England towns, as the city green (a commons area). The city also instituted
    the first public tree planting program in America. As in other cities, many of
    the elms that gave New Haven the nickname "Elm City" perished in the mid-20th
    century due to Dutch Elm disease, although many have since been replanted. The
    New Haven Green is currently home to three separate historic churches which speak
    to the original theocratic nature of the city. The Green remains the social center
    of the city today. It was named a National Historic Landmark in 1970.
  question: In what year did it became recognize as a landmark?

    \ the Xbox 360. It was first announced on June 1, 2009 at the Electronic Entertainment\
    \ Expo, under the codename, Project Natal. The add-on peripheral enables users\
    \ to control and interact with the Xbox 360 without a game controller by using\
    \ gestures, spoken commands and presented objects and images. The Kinect accessory\
    \ is compatible with all Xbox 360 models, connecting to new models via a custom\
    \ connector, and to older ones via a USB and mains power adapter. During their\
    \ CES 2010 keynote speech, Robbie Bach and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer went on\
    \ to say that Kinect will be released during the holiday period (November\u2013\
    January) and it will work with every 360 console. Its name and release date of\
    \ 2010-11-04 were officially announced on 2010-06-13, prior to Microsoft's press\
    \ conference at E3 2010."
  question: How did Microsoft describe Kinect?
- answer: Herbert Chapman
  context: "Arsenal appointed Herbert Chapman as manager in 1925. Having already won\
    \ the league twice with Huddersfield Town in 1923\u201324 and 1924\u201325 (see\
    \ Seasons in English football), Chapman brought Arsenal their first period of\
    \ major success. His revolutionary tactics and training, along with the signings\
    \ of star players such as Alex James and Cliff Bastin, laid the foundations of\
    \ the club's domination of English football in the 1930s. Under his guidance Arsenal\
    \ won their first major trophies \u2013 victory in the 1930 FA Cup Final preceded\
    \ two League Championships, in 1930\u201331 and 1932\u201333. In addition, Chapman\
    \ was behind the 1932 renaming of the local London Underground station from \"\
    Gillespie Road\" to \"Arsenal\", making it the only Tube station to be named specifically\
    \ after a football club."
  question: What manager was appointed to lead Arsenal in 1925?
- answer: Nagorno-Karabakh conflict
  context: Nevertheless, the government was able to make wide-ranging economic reforms
    that paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth. The 1994 cease-fire
    in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has also helped the economy. Armenia has had
    strong economic growth since 1995, building on the turnaround that began the previous
    year, and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors,
    such as precious-stone processing and jewellery making, information and communication
    technology, and even tourism are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors
    of the economy, such as agriculture.
  question: What did Armenia declare a cease-fire to in 1994?
- answer: Book of Isaiah
  context: "The group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a\
    \ passage in the Book of Isaiah. In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major\
    \ label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in\
    \ Black. The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album,\
    \ scoring their first major hit \"No, No, No\". The album established the group\
    \ as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group\
    \ three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year, Best\
    \ R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B/Soul Single for \"No, No, No\". The\
    \ group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in\
    \ 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as\
    \ \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\"\
    \ and \"Say My Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and\
    \ would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say My Name\" won the Best R&B\
    \ Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd\
    \ Annual Grammy Awards. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million\
    \ copies worldwide. During this time, Beyonc\xE9 recorded a duet with Marc Nelson,\
    \ an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \"After All Is Said and Done\"\
    \ for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man."
  question: The name Destiny's Child was based on a quote in which book of the Bible?
- answer: corn
  context: "The earliest evidence of human inhabitants of modern day Chihuahua was\
    \ discovered in the area of Samalayuca and Rancho Colorado. Clovis points have\
    \ been found in northeastern Chihuahua that have been dated from 12,000 BC to\
    \ 7000 BC. It is thought that these inhabitants were hunter gatherers. Inhabitants\
    \ of the state later developed farming with the domestication of corn. An archeological\
    \ site in northern Chihuahua known as Cerro Juanaque\xF1a revealed squash cultivation,\
    \ irrigation techniques, and ceramic artifacts dating to around 2000 BC."
  question: Which vegetable were they found to have been farming?
- answer: Flight
  context: Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate
    classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is
    used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various
    adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles,
    the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the
    supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.
    Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds
    combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About
    60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness
    often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and
    the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature
    and movements to "fly" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.
  question: What is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species?
- answer: wheat
  context: The province is traditionally known as the "Land of Fish and Rice". True
    to its name, rice is the main crop, followed by wheat; north Zhejiang is also
    a center of aquaculture in China, and the Zhoushan fishery is the largest fishery
    in the country. The main cash crops include jute and cotton, and the province
    also leads the provinces of China in tea production. (The renowned Longjing tea
    is a product of Hangzhou.) Zhejiang's towns have been known for handicraft production
    of goods such as silk, for which it is ranked second among the provinces. Its
    many market towns connect the cities with the countryside.
  question: What is the second main crop of the province?
- answer: '1996'
  context: The content of the acts, particularly section 1 (1) of the amending act
    of 1938, shows the importance which was then attached to giving architects the
    responsibility of superintending or supervising the building works of local authorities
    (for housing and other projects), rather than persons professionally qualified
    only as municipal or other engineers. By the 1970s another issue had emerged affecting
    education for qualification and registration for practice as an architect, due
    to the obligation imposed on the United Kingdom and other European governments
    to comply with European Union Directives concerning mutual recognition of professional
    qualifications in favour of equal standards across borders, in furtherance of
    the policy for a single market of the European Union. This led to proposals for
    reconstituting ARCUK. Eventually, in the 1990s, before proceeding, the government
    issued a consultation paper "Reform of Architects Registration" (1994). The change
    of name to "Architects Registration Board" was one of the proposals which was
    later enacted in the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 and
    reenacted as the Architects Act 1997; another was the abolition of the ARCUK Board
    of Architectural Education.
  question: When did the name of ARCUK change?
- answer: six percent
  context: "Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class\
    \ or culture; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported\
    \ legal hunting, although relatively few Americans actually hunt. At the beginning\
    \ of the 21st century, just six percent of Americans hunted. Southerners in states\
    \ along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent, slightly below\
    \ the national average, and while hunting was more common in other parts of the\
    \ South at nine percent, these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states,\
    \ where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted. Hunting in other areas of the\
    \ country fell below the national average. Overall, in the 1996\u20132006 period,\
    \ the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent, a drop\
    \ attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation\
    \ habits."
  question: What percentage of Americans actually hunted at the beginning of the 21st
    century?
- answer: Air Force Personnel Center at Randolph Air Force Base
  context: During the board process an officer's record is reviewed by a selection
    board at the Air Force Personnel Center at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio,
    Texas. At the 10 to 11 year mark, captains will take part in a selection board
    to major. If not selected, they will meet a follow-on board to determine if they
    will be allowed to remain in the Air Force. Promotion from major to lieutenant
    colonel is similar and occurs approximately between the thirteen year (for officers
    who were promoted to major early "below the zone") and the fifteen year mark,
    where a certain percentage of majors will be selected below zone (i.e., "early"),
    in zone (i.e., "on time") or above zone (i.e., "late") for promotion to lieutenant
    colonel. This process will repeat at the 16 year mark (for officers previously
    promoted early to major and lieutenant colonel) to the 21 year mark for promotion
    to full colonel.
  question: Where is an officer's record in the USAF reviewed for a promotion?
- answer: 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts
  context: Many arrangements of electrical contacts are used. Large lamps may have
    a screw base (one or more contacts at the tip, one at the shell) or a bayonet
    base (one or more contacts on the base, shell used as a contact or used only as
    a mechanical support). Some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either
    end. Miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts, and some automotive
    and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires. Contacts
    in the lamp socket allow the electric current to pass through the base to the
    filament. Power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt
    to about 10,000 watts.
  question: What is the range of power ratings for incandescent bulbs?
- answer: Stephen Smith
  context: Following the events in Olympia, there were reports that China requested
    permission to deploy People's Liberation Army personnel along the relay route
    to protect the flame in Canberra. Australian authorities stated that such a request,
    if it were to be made, would be refused. Chinese officials labeled it a rumor.
    Australian police have been given powers to search relay spectators, following
    a call by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association for Chinese Australian
    students to "go defend our sacred torch" against "ethnic degenerate scum and anti-China
    separatists". Tony Goh, chairman of the Australian Council of Chinese Organisations,
    has said the ACCO would be taking "thousands" of pro-Beijing demonstrators to
    Canberra by bus, to support the torch relay. Zhang Rongan, a Chinese Australian
    student organising pro-Beijing demonstrations, told the press that Chinese diplomats
    were assisting with the organization of buses, meals and accommodation for pro-Beijing
    demonstrators, and helping them organise a "peaceful show of strength". Foreign
    Minister Stephen Smith said Chinese officials were urging supporters to "turn
    up and put a point of view", but that he had no objection to it as long as they
    remained peaceful.
  question: Who was the Foreign Minister who indicated Chinese officials wanted supporting
    demonstrators to show up and show their point of view?
- answer: clear box testing
  context: White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing,
    transparent box testing and structural testing, by seeing the source code) tests
    internal structures or workings of a program, as opposed to the functionality
    exposed to the end-user. In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system,
    as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases. The tester chooses
    inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the appropriate outputs.
    This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (ICT).
  question: What is another term used for White-box testing?
- answer: Philosophy of the Revolution
  context: The Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum hosted a public celebration for the officers'
    return despite reservations from the royal government, which had been pressured
    by the British to prevent the reception. The apparent difference in attitude between
    the government and the general public increased Nasser's determination to topple
    the monarchy. Nasser had also felt bitter that his brigade had not been relieved
    despite the resilience it displayed. He started writing his book Philosophy of
    the Revolution during the siege.
  question: What book did Nasser start writing?
- answer: aerodrome with facilities for flights to take off and land
  context: An airport is an aerodrome with facilities for flights to take off and
    land. Airports often have facilities to store and maintain aircraft, and a control
    tower. An airport consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible
    open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway
    for a plane to take off or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings
    such as control towers, hangars  and terminals. Larger airports may have fixed
    base operator services, airport aprons, air traffic control centres, passenger
    facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services.
  question: What is an airport?
- answer: relationships
  context: "The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members\
    \ of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent.\
    \ As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences\
    \ between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested\
    \ in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual\
    \ to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence\
    \ is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily\
    \ influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the\
    \ first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes\
    \ this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of\
    \ an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual.\
    \ These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent\
    \ understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has\
    \ that specific type of personality. \"The use of psychological comparisons could\
    \ serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as\
    \ a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing\
    \ one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up\
    \ the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and, ... such a\
    \ theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons).\"\
    \ This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one\u2019\
    s identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores\
    \ the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one\u2019s development.\
    \ In social comparison we use reference groups, with respect to both psychological\
    \ and identity development. These reference groups are the peers of adolescents.\
    \ This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate\
    \ with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore\
    \ have a huge impact on who they become. Research shows that relationships have\
    \ the largest affect over the social development of an individual."
  question: What has the largest affect over one's social development?
- answer: February 2016
  context: To Kill a Mockingbird was Lee's only published book until Go Set a Watchman,
    an earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, was published on July 14, 2015. Lee
    continued to respond to her work's impact until her death in February 2016, although
    she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.
  question: When did Lee die?
- answer: Myanma Economic Bank sharing 51 percent
  context: In December 2014, Myanmar signed an agreement to set up its first stock
    exchange. The Yangon Stock Exchange Joint Venture Co. Ltd will be set up with
    Myanma Economic Bank sharing 51 percent, Japan's Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd
    30.25 percent and Japan Exchange Group 18.75 percent. The Yangon Stock Exchange
    (YSX) officially opened for business on Friday, March 25, 2016. First Myanmar
    Investment Co., Ltd. (FMI) became the first stock to be traded after receiving
    approval for an opening price of 26,000 kyats ($22).
  question: W is set to to be the major stock holder of the business that first rang
    a bell to begin in the winter of 2014 in Myanmar ?
- answer: six
  context: "Beyonc\xE9 has won 20 Grammy Awards, both as a solo artist and member\
    \ of Destiny's Child, making her the second most honored female artist by the\
    \ Grammys, behind Alison Krauss and the most nominated woman in Grammy Award history\
    \ with 52 nominations. \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" won Song of the Year\
    \ in 2010 while \"Say My Name\" and \"Crazy in Love\" had previously won Best\
    \ R&B Song. Dangerously in Love, B'Day and I Am... Sasha Fierce have all won Best\

    \ for Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture."
  question: Beyonce holds the record for how many wins in one night by a female?
- answer: Philosophy
  context: "Philosophy has become an increasingly academic discipline. More of its\
    \ practitioners lament this situation than occurs with the sciences; nonetheless\
    \ most new philosophical work appears in academic journals. Major philosophers\
    \ through history\u2014Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Augustine, Descartes, Kierkegaard,\
    \ Nietzsche\u2014have become as canonical as any writers. Some recent philosophy\
    \ works are argued to merit the title \"literature\", but much of it does not,\
    \ and some areas, such as logic, have become extremely technical to a degree similar\
    \ to that of mathematics."
  question: What classic area of study is now mostly reserved for academic consideration?
- answer: the main dome of Diaz's new senate hall
  context: Diaz's plans called for the entire city to eventually be modernized or
    rebuilt in the Porfirian/French style of the Colonia Roma; but the Mexican Revolution
    began soon afterward and the plans never came to fruition, with many projects
    being left half-completed. One of the best examples of this is the Monument to
    the Mexican Revolution. Originally the monument was to be the main dome of Diaz's
    new senate hall, but when the revolution erupted only the dome of the senate hall
    and its supporting pillars were completed, this was subsequently seen as a symbol
    by many Mexicans that the Porfirian era was over once and for all and as such,
    it was turned into a monument to victory over Diaz.
  question: What was turned into a monument after the war?
- answer: Protestants
  context: The population of the province in 1900 was 1,996,626 people, with a religious
    makeup of 1,698,465 Protestants, 269,196 Roman Catholics, and 13,877 Jews. The
    Low Prussian dialect predominated in East Prussia, although High Prussian was
    spoken in Warmia. The numbers of Masurians, Kursenieki and Prussian Lithuanians
    decreased over time due to the process of Germanization. The Polish-speaking population
    concentrated in the south of the province (Masuria and Warmia) and all German
    geographic atlases at the start of 20th century showed the southern part of East
    Prussia as Polish with the number of Poles estimated at the time to be 300,000.
    Kursenieki inhabited the areas around the Curonian lagoon, while Lithuanian-speaking
    Prussians concentrated in the northeast in (Lithuania Minor). The Old Prussian
    ethnic group became completely Germanized over time and the Old Prussian language
    died out in the 18th century.
  question: Which religious group made up the majority of the population in Prussia?
- answer: June 1944
  context: "In December 1943, President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower \u2013 not\
    \ Marshall \u2013 would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. The following month,\
    \ he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated\
    \ as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), serving\
    \ in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945. He was charged\
    \ in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the\
    \ coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord, the liberation\
    \ of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany."
  question: When did Operation Overlord take place?
- answer: army and police
  context: In the aftermath of the 1986 U.S. attack, the army was purged of perceived
    disloyal elements, and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation of a popular militia
    to replace the army and police. In 1987, Libya began production of mustard gas
    at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical
    weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to develop nuclear weapons. The period also
    saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the
    Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination
    attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces
    raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October
    1993, elements of the increasingly marginalised army initiated a failed coup in
    Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi,
    and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary
    Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.
  question: What bodies were intended to be replaced by the popular militia created
    in 1988?
- answer: oryoshi
  context: Under the early courts, when military conscription had been centrally controlled,
    military affairs had been taken out of the hands of the provincial aristocracy.
    But as the system broke down after 792, local power holders again became the primary
    source of military strength. The re-establishment of an efficient military system
    was made gradually through a process of trial-and-error. At that time the imperial
    court did not possess an army but rather relied on an organization of professional
    warriors composed mainly of oryoshi, which were appointed to an individual province
    and tsuibushi, which were appointed over imperial circuits or for specific tasks.
    This gave rise to the Japanese military class. Nonetheless final authority rested
    with the imperial court.
  question: Warriors appointed to a province were called what?
- answer: address limitations inherent in UCR data
  context: The National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) crime statistics system
    aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data. The system is used by law enforcement
    agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes. Local,
    state, and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management
    systems. Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense
    category. The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories.
    Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system.
    In addition to the Group A offenses, eleven Group B offenses are reported with
    only the arrest information. The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based
    UCR system. As of 2004, 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data. That
    amount represents 20% of the United States population and 16% of the crime statistics
    data collected by the FBI.
  question: What is the goal of the NIBRS?
- answer: limitations of language
  context: Whitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main culprits
    in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking, and acknowledged that it may be
    difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech. After all, each
    moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and
    it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally
    the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different
    thing from what it was a moment ago. Yet the limitations of everyday living and
    everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that "material substances"
    or "essences" are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular,
    concrete processes. No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different
    by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same
    person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically
    sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next.
  question: What did Whitehead believe was a culprit in maintaining a materialistic
    way of thinking?
- answer: AIR's website
  context: Over 90 weeklies, fortnightlies and quarterlies are published in Sanskrit.
    Sudharma, a daily newspaper in Sanskrit, has been published out of Mysore, India,
    since 1970, while Sanskrit Vartman Patram and Vishwasya Vrittantam started in
    Gujarat during the last five years. Since 1974, there has been a short daily news
    broadcast on state-run All India Radio. These broadcasts are also made available
    on the internet on AIR's website. Sanskrit news is broadcast on TV and on the
    internet through the DD National channel at 6:55 AM IST.
  question: Where can the Sanskrit broadcasts be found online?

  context: The United States Army maintains the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense
    Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll. Marshallese land owners receive rent for the base.
  question: What organization operates the missile test site?
- answer: Architectural
  context: "Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek \u1F00\u03C1\u03C7\u03B9\

  question: What is the latin word for architecture?
- answer: 9th century
  context: "From the 9th century, the Pecheneg nomads began an uneasy relationship\
    \ with Kievan Rus\u2032. For over two centuries they launched sporadic raids into\
    \ the lands of Rus\u2032, which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars (such\
    \ as the 920 war on the Pechenegs by Igor of Kiev reported in the Primary Chronicle),\
    \ but there were also temporary military alliances (e.g. the 943 Byzantine campaign\
    \ by Igor). In 968, the Pechenegs attacked and besieged the city of Kiev. Some\
    \ speculation exists that the Pechenegs drove off the Tivertsi and the Ulichs\
    \ to the regions of the upper Dniester river in Bukovina. The Byzantine Empire\
    \ was known to support the Pechenegs in their military campaigns against the Eastern\
    \ Slavic states.[citation needed]"
  question: How early did the relationship begin between the Pecheneg and the Rus?
- answer: between 1945 and 1948
  context: "Pan-Slavism, a movement which came into prominence in the mid-19th century,\
    \ emphasized the common heritage and unity of all the Slavic peoples. The main\
    \ focus was in the Balkans where the South Slavs had been ruled for centuries\
    \ by other empires: the Byzantine Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire,\
    \ and Venice. The Russian Empire used Pan-Slavism as a political tool; as did\
    \ the Soviet Union, which gained political-military influence and control over\
    \ most Slavic-majority nations between 1945 and 1948 and retained a hegemonic\
    \ role until the period 1989\u20131991."
  question: When did the Soviet Union gain political-military influence and control
    over most Slavic-majority nations?
- answer: Rosario Robles
  context: "The first elected head of government was Cuauht\xE9moc C\xE1rdenas. C\xE1\
    rdenas resigned in 1999 to run in the 2000 presidential elections and designated\
    \ Rosario Robles to succeed him, who became the first woman (elected or otherwise)\
    \ to govern Mexico City. In 2000 Andr\xE9s Manuel L\xF3pez Obrador was elected,\
    \ and resigned in 2005 to run in the 2006 presidential elections, Alejandro Encinas\
    \ being designated by the Legislative Assembly to finish the term. In 2006, Marcelo\
    \ Ebrard was elected for the 2006\u20132012 period."
  question: Who was the first woman to run Mexico City?
- answer: Perdiccas
  context: The first of the Diadochi wars broke out when Perdiccas planned to marry
    Alexander's sister Cleopatra and began to question Antigonus I Monophthalmus'
    leadership in Asia Minor. Antigonus fled for Greece, and then, together with Antipater
    and Craterus (the satrap of Cilicia who had been in Greece fighting the Lamian
    war) invaded Anatolia. The rebels were supported by Lysimachus, the satrap of
    Thrace and Ptolemy, the satrap of Egypt. Although Eumenes, satrap of Cappadocia,
    defeated the rebels in Asia Minor, Perdiccas himself was murdered by his own generals
    Peithon, Seleucus, and Antigenes (possibly with Ptolemy's aid) during his invasion
    of Egypt (c. 21 May to 19 June, 320). Ptolemy came to terms with Perdiccas's murderers,
    making Peithon and Arrhidaeus regents in his place, but soon these came to a new
    agreement with Antipater at the Treaty of Triparadisus. Antipater was made regent
    of the Empire, and the two kings were moved to Macedon. Antigonus remained in
    charge of Asia minor, Ptolemy retained Egypt, Lysimachus retained Thrace and Seleucus
    I controlled Babylon.
  question: Peithon, Seleucus, and Antigenes murdered whom?
- answer: Chesterfield
  context: The portion of the city south of the James River is known as the Southside.
    Neighborhoods in the city's Southside area range from affluent and middle class
    suburban neighborhoods Westover Hills, Forest Hill, Southampton, Stratford Hills,
    Oxford, Huguenot Hills, Hobby Hill, and Woodland Heights to the impoverished Manchester
    and Blackwell areas, the Hillside Court housing projects, and the ailing Jefferson
    Davis Highway commercial corridor. Other Southside neighborhoods include Fawnbrook,
    Broad Rock, Cherry Gardens, Cullenwood, and Beaufont Hills. Much of Southside
    developed a suburban character as part of Chesterfield County before being annexed
    by Richmond, most notably in 1970.
  question: Prior to joining Richmond, what county was a significant portion of Southside
    part of?
- answer: Mavericks
  context: In 2001, Apple introduced Mac OS X, based on Darwin and NEXTSTEP; its new
    features included the Dock and the Aqua user interface. During the transition,
    Apple included a virtual machine subsystem known as Classic, allowing users to
    run Mac OS 9 applications under Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier on PowerPC machines.
    Apple introduced Mac OS X 10.8 in February, and it was made available in the summer
    of 2012. Mountain Lion includes many new features, such as Mission Control, the
    Mac App Store (available to Mac OS X v10.6.6 "Snow Leopard." users by software
    update), Launchpad, an application viewer and launcher akin to the iOS Home Screen,
    and Resume, a feature similar to the hibernate function found in Microsoft Windows.
    The most recent version is OS X El Capitan . In addition to Mavericks, all new
    Macs are bundled with assorted Apple-produced applications, including iLife, the
    Safari web browser and the iTunes media player. Apple introduced Mavericks at
    WWDC 2013 in June, and released it on October 15 of that year. It is free of charge
    to everyone running Snow Leopard or later and is compatible with most Macs from
    2007 and later. Mavericks brought a lot of the iOS apps, functions, and feel to
    the Mac as well as better multi display support, iBooks, Maps, app nap, and other
    upgrades to improve performance and battery life.
  question: What brought better multi display support to Mac?
- answer: April 25, 2014
  context: "Spielberg was scheduled to shoot a $200 million adaptation of Daniel H.\
    \ Wilson's novel Robopocalypse, adapted for the screen by Drew Goddard. The film\
    \ would follow a global human war against a robot uprising about 15\u201320 years\
    \ in the future. Like Lincoln, it was to be released by Disney in the United States\
    \ and Fox overseas. It was set for release on April 25, 2014, with Anne Hathaway\
    \ and Chris Hemsworth set to star, but Spielberg postponed production indefinitely\
    \ in January 2013, just before it had been set to begin."
  question: When was 'Robopocalypse' scheduled for release?
- answer: Germany
  context: After the ceasefire following the Fall of France in June 1940, Alsace was
    annexed to Germany and a rigorous policy of Germanisation was imposed upon it
    by the Gauleiter Robert Heinrich Wagner. When, in July 1940, the first evacuees
    were allowed to return, only residents of Alsatian origin were admitted. The last
    Jews were deported on 15 July 1940 and the main synagogue, a huge Romanesque revival
    building that had been a major architectural landmark with its 54-metre-high dome
    since its completion in 1897, was set ablaze, then razed.
  question: What country was Alsace annexed to?
- answer: for resources
  context: Plants depend on certain edaphic (soil) and climatic factors in their environment
    but can modify these factors too. For example, they can change their environment's
    albedo, increase runoff interception, stabilize mineral soils and develop their
    organic content, and affect local temperature. Plants compete with other organisms
    in their ecosystem for resources. They interact with their neighbours at a variety
    of spatial scales in groups, populations and communities that collectively constitute
    vegetation. Regions with characteristic vegetation types and dominant plants as
    well as similar abiotic and biotic factors, climate, and geography make up biomes
    like tundra or tropical rainforest.
  question: How do plants interact with other species in their environment?
- answer: water pollution
  context: Pesticide use raises a number of environmental concerns. Over 98% of sprayed
    insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target
    species, including non-target species, air, water and soil. Pesticide drift occurs
    when pesticides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other
    areas, potentially contaminating them. Pesticides are one of the causes of water
    pollution, and some pesticides are persistent organic pollutants and contribute
    to soil contamination.
  question: Pesticides contribute to what sort of pollution?
- answer: University of Southampton
  context: A Royal Charter in 1952 upgraded University College at Highfield to the
    University of Southampton. Southampton acquired city status, becoming the City
    of Southampton in 1964.
  question: What is the new name of University College at Highfield?
- answer: buttresses
  context: On the exterior, the verticality is emphasised in a major way by the towers
    and spires and in a lesser way by strongly projecting vertical buttresses, by
    narrow half-columns called attached shafts which often pass through several storeys
    of the building, by long narrow windows, vertical mouldings around doors and figurative
    sculpture which emphasises the vertical and is often attenuated. The roofline,
    gable ends, buttresses and other parts of the building are often terminated by
    small pinnacles, Milan Cathedral being an extreme example in the use of this form
    of decoration.
  question: What other part of Gothic buildings are often found terminated with small
    pinnacles?
- answer: Women
  context: Although the eastern image of farm life in the prairies emphasized the
    isolation of the lonely farmer and wife, plains residents created busy social
    lives for themselves. They often sponsored activities that combined work, food
    and entertainment such as barn raisings, corn huskings, quilting bees, Grange
    meetings, church activities and school functions. Women organized shared meals
    and potluck events, as well as extended visits between families. The Grange was
    a nationwide farmers' organization, they reserved high offices for women, and
    gave them a voice in public affairs.
  question: who usually organized shared meals and potluck events?
- answer: to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea
  context: Greater London's population declined steadily in the decades after the
    Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8
    million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe
    and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration,
    including the Canary Wharf development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing
    role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s. The Thames Barrier
    was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North
    Sea.
  question: What was the primary function of the Thames Barrier?
- answer: to help feed and support the family
  context: "Many factors played a role in Britain\u2019s long-term economic growth,\
    \ such as the industrial revolution in the late 1700s and the prominent presence\
    \ of child labour during the industrial age. Children who worked at an early age\
    \ were often not forced; but did so because they needed to help their family survive\
    \ financially. Due to poor employment opportunities for many parents, sending\
    \ their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and\
    \ support the family. Child Labour first started to occur in England when household\
    \ businesses were turned into local labour markets that mass-produced the once\
    \ homemade goods. Because children often helped produce the goods out of their\
    \ homes, working in a factory to make those same goods was a simple change for\
    \ many of these youths. Although there are many counts of children under the age\
    \ of ten working for factories, the majority of children workers were between\
    \ the ages of ten and fourteen. This age range was an important time for many\
    \ youths as they were first helping to provide for their families; while also\
    \ transitioning to save for their own future families."
  question: If not forced why did children work?
- answer: tile
  context: Islamic architecture used mosaic technique to decorate religious buildings
    and palaces after the Muslim conquests of the eastern provinces of the Byzantine
    Empire. In Syria and Egypt the Arabs were influenced by the great tradition of
    Roman and Early Christian mosaic art. During the Umayyad Dynasty mosaic making
    remained a flourishing art form in Islamic culture and it is continued in the
    art of zellige and azulejo in various parts of the Arab world, although tile was
    to become the main Islamic form of wall decoration.
  question: What would later become the main Islamic form of wall decoration?
- answer: up to 90
  context: Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century
    from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry
    dozens of aircraft, including fighter jets and helicopters. As of 3 March 2016,
    there are thirty-seven active aircraft carriers in the world within twelve navies.
    The United States Navy has 10 large nuclear-powered carriers (known as supercarriers,
    carrying up to 90 aircraft each), the largest carriers in the world; the total
    deckspace is over twice that of all other nations' combined. As well as the supercarrier
    fleet, the US Navy has nine amphibious assault ships used primarily for helicopters
    (sometimes called helicopter carriers); these can also carry up to 25 fighter
    jets, and in some cases, are as large as some other nations' fixed-wing carriers.
  question: How many aircraft can supercarriers carry?
- answer: libel
  context: The Times was founded by publisher John Walter on 1 January 1785 as The
    Daily Universal Register, with Walter in the role of editor. Walter had lost his
    job by the end of 1784 after the insurance company where he was working went bankrupt
    because of the complaints of a Jamaican hurricane. Being unemployed, Walter decided
    to set a new business up. It was in that time when Henry Johnson invented the
    logography, a new typography that was faster and more precise (three years later,
    it was proved that it was not as efficient as had been said). Walter bought the
    logography's patent and to use it, he decided to open a printing house, where
    he would daily produce an advertising sheet. The first publication of the newspaper
    The Daily Universal Register in Great Britain was 1 January 1785. Unhappy because
    people always omitted the word Universal, Ellias changed the title after 940 editions
    on 1 January 1788 to The Times. In 1803, Walter handed ownership and editorship
    to his son of the same name. Walter Sr had spent sixteen months in Newgate Prison
    for libel printed in The Times, but his pioneering efforts to obtain Continental
    news, especially from France, helped build the paper's reputation among policy
    makers and financiers.
  question: The first publisher and editor of The Times when to prison for what crime
    when printed in his newspaper?
- answer: all populated continents
  context: Collectively encompassing more than 900 million adherents, or nearly forty
    percent of Christians worldwide, Protestantism is present on all populated continents.[t]
    The movement is more divided theologically and ecclesiastically than either Eastern
    Orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism, lacking both structural unity and central human
    authority. Some Protestant churches do have a worldwide scope and distribution
    of membership (notably, the Anglican Communion), while others are confined to
    a single country, or even are solitary church bodies or congregations (such as
    the former Prussian Union of churches). Nondenominational, evangelical, independent
    and other churches are on the rise, and constitute a significant part of Protestant
    Christianity.
  question: Which continents have some form of Protestantism?
- answer: Manshia Square
  context: In 1928, Nasser went to Alexandria to live with his maternal grandfather
    and attend the city's Attarin elementary school. He left in 1929 for a private
    boarding school in Helwan, and later returned to Alexandria to enter the Ras el-Tin
    secondary school and to join his father, who was working for the city's postal
    service. It was in Alexandria that Nasser became involved in political activism.
    After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square, he joined
    the demonstration without being aware of its purpose. The protest, organized by
    the ultranationalist Young Egypt Society, called for the end of colonialism in
    Egypt in the wake of the 1923 Egyptian constitution's annulment by Prime Minister
    Isma'il Sidqi. Nasser was arrested and detained for a night before his father
    bailed him out.
  question: Where did young Nasser witness demonstrations?
- answer: the Luftwaffe
  context: Wever argued that the Luftwaffe General Staff should not be solely educated
    in tactical and operational matters. He argued they should be educated in grand
    strategy, war economics, armament production, and the mentality of potential opponents
    (also known as mirror imaging). Wever's vision was not realised; the General Staff
    studies in those subjects fell by the wayside, and the Air Academies focused on
    tactics, technology, and operational planning, rather than on independent strategic
    air offensives.
  question: What army does the general staff belong to?
- answer: 8th
  context: "The Byzantine recovery of lost provinces began toward the end of the 8th\
    \ century and most of the Greek peninsula came under imperial control again, in\
    \ stages, during the 9th century. This process was facilitated by a large influx\
    \ of Greeks from Sicily and Asia Minor to the Greek peninsula, while at the same\
    \ time many Slavs were captured and re-settled in Asia Minor and those that remained\
    \ were assimilated. During the 11th and 12th centuries the return of stability\
    \ resulted in the Greek peninsula benefiting from strong economic growth \u2013\
    \ much stronger than that of the Anatolian territories of the Empire."
  question: The Byzantine began taking back territories during the last of what century?
- answer: January 1941
  context: Japan sponsored several puppet governments, one of which was headed by
    Wang Jingwei. However, its policies of brutality toward the Chinese population,
    of not yielding any real power to these regimes, and of supporting several rival
    governments failed to make any of them a viable alternative to the Nationalist
    government led by Chiang Kai-shek. Conflicts between Chinese communist and nationalist
    forces vying for territory control behind enemy lines culminated in a major armed
    clash in January 1941, effectively ending their co-operation.
  question: When did cooperation between communist and nationalist forces end?
- answer: dam
  context: "In breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a dog, while a female\
    \ is called a bitch (Middle English bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately\
    \ from Old Norse bikkja). A group of offspring is a litter. The father of a litter\
    \ is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam. Offspring are, in general,\
    \ called pups or puppies, from French poup\xE9e, until they are about a year old.\
    \ The process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word hwelp."
  question: What is the mother of a litter referred as?
- answer: 4.6%
  context: "According to the 2002 Census, 4.6% of the Chilean population, including\
    \ the Rapanui (a Polynesian people) of Easter Island, was indigenous, although\
    \ most show varying degrees of mixed heritage. Many are descendants of the Mapuche,\
    \ and live in Santiago, Araucan\xEDa and the lake district. The Mapuche successfully\
    \ fought off defeat in the first 300\u2013350 years of Spanish rule during the\
    \ Arauco War. Relations with the new Chilean Republic were good until the Chilean\
    \ state decided to occupy their lands. During the Occupation of Araucan\xEDa the\
    \ Mapuche surrendered to the country's army in the 1880s. Their land was opened\
    \ to settlement by Chileans and Europeans. Conflict over Mapuche land rights continues\
    \ to the present."
  question: What percent of the Chilean population were indigenous according to the
    2002 census?
- answer: 7 September 1940
  context: Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941, 16 British cities suffered aerial
    raids with at least 100 long tons of high explosives. Over a period of 267 days,
    London was attacked 71 times, Birmingham, Liverpool and Plymouth eight times,
    Bristol six, Glasgow five, Southampton four, Portsmouth and Hull three and a minimum
    of one large raid on eight other cities. This was a result of a rapid escalation
    starting on 24 August 1940, when night bombers aiming for RAF airfields drifted
    off course and accidentally destroyed several London homes, killing civilians,
    combined with the UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill's retaliatory bombing of
    Berlin on the following night.[clarification needed]
  question: What was the beginning date of the aerial raids on Great Britain?
- answer: an abrasive, confrontational and nihilistic
  context: Also emerging during this period was New York's no wave movement, a short-lived
    art and music scene that began in part as a reaction against punk's recycling
    of traditionalist rock tropes and often reflected an abrasive, confrontational
    and nihilistic worldview. No wave musicians such as the Contortions, Teenage Jesus
    and the Jerks, Mars, DNA, Theoretical Girls and Rhys Chatham instead experimented
    with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock styles. The former
    four groups were included on the Eno-produced No New York compilation, often considered
    the quintessential testament to the scene. The no wave-affiliated label ZE Records
    was founded in 1978, and would also produce acclaimed and influential compilations
    in subsequent years.
  question: What type of a view did no wave have?
- answer: frequent changes between trains
  context: The effect of these differences was accentuated by the pre-war preparations.
    The Prussian General Staff had drawn up minutely detailed mobilization plans using
    the railway system, which in turn had been partly laid out in response to recommendations
    of a Railway Section within the General Staff. The French railway system, with
    multiple competing companies, had developed purely from commercial pressures and
    many journeys to the front in Alsace and Lorraine involved long diversions and
    frequent changes between trains. Furthermore, no system had been put in place
    for military control of the railways, and officers simply commandeered trains
    as they saw fit. Rail sidings and marshalling yards became choked with loaded
    wagons, with nobody responsible for unloading them or directing them to the destination.
  question: What factor especially affected travel to the front in Alsace and Lorraine?
- answer: The Green Book
  context: The son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder, Gaddafi became involved
    in politics while at school in Sabha, subsequently enrolling in the Royal Military
    Academy, Benghazi. Founding a revolutionary cell within the military, in 1969
    they seized power from the absolute monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup.
    Becoming Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), Gaddafi
    abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic. Ruling by decree, he implemented
    measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya,
    and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments. Intent on pushing Libya
    towards "Islamic socialism", he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system
    and nationalized the oil industry, using the increased revenues to bolster the
    military, implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the
    world. In 1973 he initiated a "Popular Revolution" with the formation of General
    People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but
    retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International
    Theory that year, publishing these ideas in The Green Book.
  question: What book did Gaddafi publish that detailed his Third Internal Theory?
- answer: asynchronous
  context: Panels are individual images containing a segment of action, often surrounded
    by a border. Prime moments in a narrative are broken down into panels via a process
    called encapsulation. The reader puts the pieces together via the process of closure
    by using background knowledge and an understanding of panel relations to combine
    panels mentally into events. The size, shape, and arrangement of panels each affect
    the timing and pacing of the narrative. The contents of a panel may be asynchronous,
    with events depicted in the same image not necessarily occurring at the same time.
  question: When a comic panel has events that are not at the same time the panel
    is considered to be what?
- answer: high-quality iron ore
  context: The Alps are a source of minerals that have been mined for thousands of
    years. In the 8th to 6th centuries BC during the Hallstatt culture, Celtic tribes
    mined copper; later the Romans mined gold for coins in the Bad Gastein area. Erzberg
    in Styria furnishes high-quality iron ore for the steel industry. Crystals are
    found throughout much of the Alpine region such as cinnabar, amethyst, and quartz.
    The cinnabar deposits in Slovenia are a notable source of cinnabar pigments.
  question: What does Erzberd in Styria furnish?
- answer: infinite canvas
  context: "Webcomics are comics that are available on the internet. They are able\
    \ to reach large audiences, and new readers usually can access archived installments.\
    \ Webcomics can make use of an infinite canvas\u2014meaning they are not constrained\
    \ by size or dimensions of a page."
  question: Not held back by size limits, webcomics are said to have a what?
- answer: a voltage reversal
  context: In DC circuits and pulsed circuits, current and voltage reversal are affected
    by the damping of the system. Voltage reversal is encountered in RLC circuits
    that are under-damped. The current and voltage reverse direction, forming a harmonic
    oscillator between the inductance and capacitance. The current and voltage will
    tend to oscillate and may reverse direction several times, with each peak being
    lower than the previous, until the system reaches an equilibrium. This is often
    referred to as ringing. In comparison, critically damped or over-damped systems
    usually do not experience a voltage reversal. Reversal is also encountered in
    AC circuits, where the peak current will be equal in each direction.
  question: When a system is over-damped, what does it typically not experience?
- answer: Control Panel
  context: Windows 8 introduces significant changes to the operating system's user
    interface, many of which are aimed at improving its experience on tablet computers
    and other touchscreen devices. The new user interface is based on Microsoft's
    Metro design language, and uses a Start screen similar to that of Windows Phone
    7 as the primary means of launching applications. The Start screen displays a
    customizable array of tiles linking to various apps and desktop programs, some
    of which can display constantly updated information and content through "live
    tiles". As a form of multi-tasking, apps can be snapped to the side of a screen.
    Alongside the traditional Control Panel, a new simplified and touch-optimized
    settings app known as "PC Settings" is used for basic configuration and user settings.
    It does not include many of the advanced options still accessible from the normal
    Control Panel.
  question: Where can advanced settings options be found?
- answer: '193'
  context: On 8 June 1856, the next settlement began on Norfolk Island. These were
    the descendants of Tahitians and the HMS Bounty mutineers, including those of
    Fletcher Christian. They resettled from the Pitcairn Islands, which had become
    too small for their growing population. On 3 May 1856, 193 persons left Pitcairn
    Islands aboard the "Morayshire". On 8 June 194 persons arrived, a baby having
    been born in transit. The Pitcairners occupied many of the buildings remaining
    from the penal settlements, and gradually established traditional farming and
    whaling industries on the island. Although some families decided to return to
    Pitcairn in 1858 and 1863, the island's population continued to grow. They accepted
    additional settlers, who often arrived with whaling fleets.
  question: On May 3, 1856, how many Pitcairners left for Norfolk Island?
- answer: non-Vedic
  context: Historically, the roots of Buddhism lie in the religious thought of ancient
    India during the second half of the first millennium BCE. That was a period of
    social and religious turmoil, as there was significant discontent with the sacrifices
    and rituals of Vedic Brahmanism.[note 15] It was challenged by numerous new ascetic
    religious and philosophical groups and teachings that broke with the Brahmanic
    tradition and rejected the authority of the Vedas and the Brahmans.[note 16] These
    groups, whose members were known as shramanas, were a continuation of a non-Vedic
    strand of Indian thought distinct from Indo-Aryan Brahmanism.[note 17] Scholars
    have reasons to believe that ideas such as samsara, karma (in the sense of the
    influence of morality on rebirth), and moksha originated in the shramanas, and
    were later adopted by Brahmin orthodoxy.[note 18][note 19][note 20][note 21][note
    22][note 23]
  question: Shramanas were a continuation of what type of trand of Indian thought?
- answer: "\xE9lite ideal"
  context: "In practice, culture referred to an \xE9lite ideal and was associated\
    \ with such activities as art, classical music, and haute cuisine. As these forms\
    \ were associated with urban life, \"culture\" was identified with \"civilization\"\
    \ (from lat. civitas, city). Another facet of the Romantic movement was an interest\
    \ in folklore, which led to identifying a \"culture\" among non-elites. This distinction\
    \ is often characterized as that between high culture, namely that of the ruling\
    \ social group, and low culture. In other words, the idea of \"culture\" that\
    \ developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities\
    \ within European societies."
  question: What did culture refer to in practice?
- answer: '2002'
  context: In 2002, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, a party with about 10% of the Legislative
    Yuan seats at the time, suggested making Taiwanese a second official language.
    This proposal encountered strong opposition not only from Mainlander groups but
    also from Hakka and Taiwanese aboriginal groups who felt that it would slight
    their home languages, as well as others including Hoklo who objected to the proposal
    on logistical grounds and on the grounds that it would increase ethnic tensions.
    Because of these objections, support for this measure was lukewarm among moderate
    Taiwan independence supporters, and the proposal did not pass.
  question: What year was it proposed to make Taiwanese the second official language?
- answer: '1837'
  context: "In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author\
    \ George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin). Short (under five feet,\
    \ or 152 cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker, she initially repelled Chopin,\
    \ who remarked, \"What an unattractive person la Sand is. Is she really a woman?\"\
    \ However, by early 1837 Maria Wodzi\u0144ska's mother had made it clear to Chopin\
    \ in correspondence that a marriage with her daughter was unlikely to proceed.\
    \ It is thought that she was influenced by his poor health and possibly also by\
    \ rumours about his associations with women such as d'Agoult and Sand. Chopin\
    \ finally placed the letters from Maria and her mother in a package on which he\
    \ wrote, in Polish, \"My tragedy\". Sand, in a letter to Grzyma\u0142a of June\
    \ 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon\
    \ a current affair in order to begin a relationship with Chopin; she asked Grzyma\u0142\
    a to assess Chopin's relationship with Maria Wodzi\u0144ska, without realising\
    \ that the affair, at least from Maria's side, was over."
  question: "What year did Maria Wodzi\u0144ska's mother tell Chopin that he likely\
    \ would not marry her daughter?"
- answer: Middle Pleistocene
  context: Isolated remains of Homo erectus in Hathnora in the Narmada Valley in central
    India indicate that India might have been inhabited since at least the Middle
    Pleistocene era, somewhere between 500,000 and 200,000 years ago. Tools crafted
    by proto-humans that have been dated back two million years have been discovered
    in the northwestern part of the subcontinent. The ancient history of the region
    includes some of South Asia's oldest settlements and some of its major civilisations.
    The earliest archaeological site in the subcontinent is the palaeolithic hominid
    site in the Soan River valley. Soanian sites are found in the Sivalik region across
    what are now India, Pakistan, and Nepal.
  question: By what era was India inhabited by humans of some form?
- answer: 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict
  context: Beyond this, BYU also runs a very large study abroad program, with satellite
    centers in London, Jerusalem, and Paris, as well as more than 20 other sites.
    Nearly 2,000 students take advantage of these programs yearly. In 2001, the Institute
    of International Education ranked BYU as the number one university in the U.S.
    to offer students study abroad opportunities. The BYU Jerusalem Center, which
    was closed in 2000 due to student security concerns related to the Second Intifada
    and, more recently, the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, was reopened to students
    in the Winter 2007 semester.
  question: What was the most recent conflict that affected the closure of BYU Jerusalem
    Center from 2000-2007?
- answer: Chris Daughtry
  context: Chris Daughtry's performance of Fuel's "Hemorrhage (In My Hands)" on the
    show was widely praised and led to an invitation to join the band as Fuel's new
    lead singer, an invitation he declined. His performance of Live's version of "I
    Walk the Line" was well received by the judges but later criticized in some quarters
    for not crediting the arrangement to Live. He was eliminated at the top four in
    a shocking result.
  question: Who was eliminated in the Top 4 show?

  context: "On December 24, Yeltsin informed the Secretary-General of the United Nations\
    \ that by agreement of the member states of the CIS Russian Federation would assume\
    \ the membership of the Soviet Union in all UN organs (including permanent membership\
    \ in the UN Security Council). Thus, Russia is considered to be an original member\
    \ of the UN (since October 24, 1945) along with Ukraine (Ukrainian SSR) and Belarus\
    \ (Byelorussian SSR). On December 25\u2014just hours after Gorbachev resigned\
    \ as president of the Soviet Union\u2014the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian\
    \ Federation (Russia), reflecting that it was now a sovereign state with Yeltsin\
    \ assuming the Presidency. The change was originally published on January 6, 1992\
    \ (Rossiyskaya Gazeta). According to law, during 1992, it was allowed to use the\
    \ old name of the RSFSR for official business (forms, seals and stamps). The Russian\

- answer: "L\xE9ger"
  context: "This technique of representing simultaneity, multiple viewpoints (or relative\
    \ motion) is pushed to a high degree of complexity in Gleizes' monumental Le D\xE9\
    piquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing), exhibited at the 1912 Salon de la Section\

  context: "Bateman was responsible for the building of 36 new buildings for the university\
    \ both on and off campus, including the expansion of the Harold B. Lee Library.\
    \ He was also one of several key college leaders who brought about the creation\
    \ of the Mountain West Conference, which BYU's athletics program joined \u2014\

  question: How long was the chain?
- answer: '21'
  context: Josip Broz Tito received a total of 119 awards and decorations from 60
    countries around the world (59 countries and Yugoslavia). 21 decorations were
    from Yugoslavia itself, 18 having been awarded once, and the Order of the National
    Hero on three occasions. Of the 98 international awards and decorations, 92 were
    received once, and three on two occasions (Order of the White Lion, Polonia Restituta,
    and Karl Marx). The most notable awards included the French Legion of Honour and
    National Order of Merit, the British Order of the Bath, the Soviet Order of Lenin,
    the Japanese Order of the Chrysanthemum, the German Federal Cross of Merit, and
    the Order of Merit of Italy.
  question: Of all of the awards Tito received, how many were from Yugoslavia itself?
- answer: Chenevix-Trench
  context: John Keate, Head Master from 1809 to 1834, took over at a time when discipline
    was poor. Anthony Chenevix-Trench, Head Master from 1964 to 1970, abolished the
    birch and replaced it with caning, also applied to the bare posterior, which he
    administered privately in his office. Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal
    punishment administered by senior boys. Previously, House Captains were permitted
    to cane miscreants over the seat of the trousers. This was a routine occurrence,
    carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of
    a table. Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop (see
    Eton Society below) in the form of a "Pop-Tanning", in which a large number of
    hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop
    members (or, in earlier times, each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict
    a stroke). The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers, as the
    caning would cut the cloth to shreds. This was the most severe form of physical
    punishment at Eton.
  question: Which Head Master abolished corporal punishment by peers?
- answer: bull
  context: 'Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one
    of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every
    animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years
    of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The "contract" with Jupiter is exceptionally
    detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen
    before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since
    they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their
    side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial
    period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan''s death because the gods had
    not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of
    the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial
    cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.'
  question: What was the offering for the Emperor in Pompeii?
- answer: karaoke bars
  context: Pubs that cater for a niche clientele, such as sports fans or people of
    certain nationalities are known as theme pubs. Examples of theme pubs include
    sports bars, rock pubs, biker pubs, Goth pubs, strip pubs, gay bars, karaoke bars
    and Irish pubs.
  question: In what sort of theme pub could one find visitors singing with musical
    accompaniment?
- answer: Asia and Europe
  context: The typical image of migration is of northern landbirds, such as swallows
    (Hirundinidae) and birds of prey, making long flights to the tropics. However,
    many Holarctic wildfowl and finch (Fringillidae) species winter in the North Temperate
    Zone, in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example,
    the pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus migrates from Iceland to Britain and
    neighbouring countries, whilst the dark-eyed junco Junco hyemalis migrates from
    subarctic and arctic climates to the contiguous United States and the American
    goldfinch from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the American South northwestward
    to Western Oregon. Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and
    learned by young during their first migration with their parents. Some ducks,
    such as the garganey Anas querquedula, move completely or partially into the tropics.
    The European pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca also follows this migratory trend,
    breeding in Asia and Europe and wintering in Africa.
  question: Where do the European pied flycatcher breed?
- answer: Cyprus
  context: "The majority of Cypriots receive their higher education at Greek, British,\
    \ Turkish, other European and North American universities. It is noteworthy that\
    \ Cyprus currently has the highest percentage of citizens of working age who have\
    \ higher-level education in the EU at 30% which is ahead of Finland's 29.5%. In\
    \ addition, 47% of its population aged 25\u201334 have tertiary education, which\
    \ is the highest in the EU. The body of Cypriot students is highly mobile, with\
    \ 78.7% studying in a university outside Cyprus."
  question: What nation has the highest level percentage of working citizens with
    higher-level education?
- answer: '"long-term, corrupt relationship"'
  context: "On 22 May 2015, Sun reporter Anthony France was found guilty of aiding\
    \ and abetting misconduct in a public office between 2008 and 2011. France\u2019\
    s trial followed the London Metropolitan Police's Operation Elveden, an ongoing\
    \ investigation into alleged payments to police and officials in exchange for\
    \ information. He had paid a total of more than \xA322,000 to PC Timothy Edwards,\
    \ an anti-terrorism police officer based at Heathrow Airport. The police officer\
    \ had already pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office and given a two-year\
    \ gaol sentence in 2014, but the jury in France\u2019s trial was not informed\
    \ of this. Following the passing of the guilty verdict, the officer leading Operation\
    \ Elveden, Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Briggs said France and Edwards\
    \ had been in a \"long-term, corrupt relationship\"."
  question: How did Briggs characterize the relationship between France and Edwards?
- answer: '1563'
  context: In the year 1563 the influential Ecumenical Council of Trent, headed by
    Pope Pius IV, wrote about the importance of selecting good Cardinals. According
    to this historic council "nothing is more necessary to the Church of God than
    that the holy Roman pontiff apply that solicitude which by the duty of his office
    he owes the universal Church in a very special way by associating with himself
    as cardinals the most select persons only, and appoint to each church most eminently
    upright and competent shepherds; and this the more so, because our Lord Jesus
    Christ will require at his hands the blood of the sheep of Christ that perish
    through the evil government of shepherds who are negligent and forgetful of their
    office."
  question: In what year did the Ecumenical Council of Trent write in regards to the
    selection of Cardinals?
- answer: Muammar Gaddafi
  context: Following the announcement of Nasser's death, Egypt and the Arab world
    were in a state of shock. Nasser's funeral procession through Cairo on 1 October
    was attended by at least five million mourners. The 10-kilometer (6.2 mi) procession
    to his burial site began at the old RCC headquarters with a flyover by MiG-21
    jets. His flag-draped coffin was attached to a gun carriage pulled by six horses
    and led by a column of cavalrymen. All Arab heads of state attended, with the
    exception of Saudi King Faisal. King Hussein and Arafat cried openly, and Muammar
    Gaddafi of Libya fainted from emotional distress twice. A few major non-Arab dignitaries
    were present, including Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin and French Prime Minister
    Jacques Chaban-Delmas.
  question: What leader twice fainted during the funeral?
- answer: English is the dominant language of business, education, government, religion,
    media, culture, civil society, and the public sphere.
  context: Although the United States has no de jure official language, English is
    the dominant language of business, education, government, religion, media, culture,
    civil society, and the public sphere. Virtually all state and federal government
    agencies and large corporations use English as their internal working language,
    especially at the management level. Some states, such as New Mexico, provide bilingual
    legislated notices and official documents, in Spanish and English, and other commonly
    used languages. By 2015, there was a trend that most Americans and American residents
    who are of Hispanic descent speak only English in the home.
  question: What language is spoken in the U.S.A?
- answer: Khaled Mohieddin
  context: Relations between Nasser and Qasim grew increasingly bitter on 9 March,
    after Qasim's forces suppressed a rebellion in Mosul, launched a day earlier by
    a pro-Nasser Iraqi RCC officer backed by UAR authorities. Nasser had considered
    dispatching troops to aid his Iraqi sympathizers, but decided against it. He clamped
    down on Egyptian communist activity due to the key backing Iraqi communists provided
    Qasim. Several influential communists were arrested, including Nasser's old comrade
    Khaled Mohieddin, who had been allowed to re-enter Egypt in 1956.
  question: What old ally did Nasser turn against?
- answer: Ryan Seacrest
  context: The first season was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman. Dunkleman
    quit thereafter, making Seacrest the sole emcee of the show starting with season
    two.
  question: Who was the only host of American Idol after season one?
- answer: Carrier battle groups
  context: Smaller boats and ships typically have machine-guns or fast cannons, which
    can often be deadly to low-flying aircraft if linked to a radar-directed fire-control
    system radar-controlled cannon for point defence. Some vessels like Aegis cruisers
    are as much a threat to aircraft as any land-based air defence system. In general,
    naval vessels should be treated with respect by aircraft, however the reverse
    is equally true. Carrier battle groups are especially well defended, as not only
    do they typically consist of many vessels with heavy air defence armament but
    they are also able to launch fighter jets for combat air patrol overhead to intercept
    incoming airborne threats.
  question: What type of ships are particularly well defended?
- answer: 520 BC
  context: Old Persian is the Old Iranian dialect as it was spoken in south-western
    Iran by the inhabitants of Parsa, who also gave their name to their region and
    language. Genuine Old Persian is best attested in one of the three languages of
    the Behistun inscription, composed circa 520 BC, and which is the last inscription
    (and only inscription of significant length) in which Old Persian is still grammatically
    correct. Later inscriptions are comparatively brief, and typically simply copies
    of words and phrases from earlier ones, often with grammatical errors, which suggests
    that by the 4th century BC the transition from Old Persian to Middle Persian was
    already far advanced, but efforts were still being made to retain an "old" quality
    for official proclamations.
  question: When was the Behistun inscription written?
- answer: PSP
  context: PlayStation Portable can connect with PlayStation 3 in many ways, including
    in-game connectivity. For example, Formula One Championship Edition, a racing
    game, was shown at E3 2006 using a PSP as a real-time rear-view mirror. In addition,
    users are able to download original PlayStation format games from the PlayStation
    Store, transfer and play them on PSP as well as PS3 itself. It is also possible
    to use the Remote Play feature to play these and some PlayStation Network games,
    remotely on PSP over a network or internet connection.
  question: Games in plain PlayStation format can be played both on the PS3 console
    and what other device?
- answer: "early 14th century up until \u2013 and sometimes including \u2013 the 16th\
    \ century"
  context: "Modern historiography on the period has reached a consensus between the\
    \ two extremes of innovation and crisis. It is now (generally) acknowledged that\
    \ conditions were vastly different north and south of the Alps, and \"Late Middle\
    \ Ages\" is often avoided entirely within Italian historiography. The term \"\
    Renaissance\" is still considered useful for describing certain intellectual,\
    \ cultural, or artistic developments, but not as the defining feature of an entire\
    \ European historical epoch. The period from the early 14th century up until \u2013\
    \ and sometimes including \u2013 the 16th century, is rather seen as characterised\
    \ by other trends: demographic and economic decline followed by recovery, the\
    \ end of western religious unity and the subsequent emergence of the nation state,\
    \ and the expansion of European influence onto the rest of the world."
  question: Which centuries are considered to be part of the Late Middle Ages?
- answer: Massalia
  context: "Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul were mostly limited to the Mediterranean coast\
    \ of Provence. The first Greek colony in the region was Massalia, which became\
    \ one of the largest trading ports of Mediterranean by the 4th century BCE with\
    \ 6,000 inhabitants. Massalia was also the local hegemon, controlling various\
    \ coastal Greek cities like Nice and Agde. The coins minted in Massalia have been\
    \ found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul. Celtic coinage was influenced by\
    \ Greek designs, and Greek letters can be found on various Celtic coins, especially\
    \ those of Southern France. Traders from Massalia ventured inland deep into France\
    \ on the Rivers Durance and Rh\xF4ne, and established overland trade routes deep\
    \ into Gaul, and to Switzerland and Burgundy. The Hellenistic period saw the Greek\
    \ alphabet spread into southern Gaul from Massalia (3rd and 2nd centuries BCE)\
    \ and according to Strabo, Massalia was also a center of education, where Celts\
    \ went to learn Greek. A staunch ally of Rome, Massalia retained its independence\
    \ until it sided with Pompey in 49 BCE and was then taken by Caesar's forces."
  question: What was the first Greek colony in the Mediterranean?
- answer: Economic
  context: Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its
    widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship
    with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins
    as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of Anthropology,
    Bronislaw Malinowski, and his French compatriot, Marcel Mauss, on the nature of
    gift-giving exchange (or reciprocity) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic
    Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of
    thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production,
    in contrast. Economic Anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they
    were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations,
    banks, and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective.
  question: Which branch of anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior?
- answer: Satan the Devil
  context: Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body.
    The religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices; members who
    openly disagree with the religion's teachings are expelled and shunned. Witness
    publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel
    received from the Governing Body, reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of
    "God's organization". It also warns members to "avoid independent thinking", claiming
    such thinking "was introduced by Satan the Devil" and would "cause division".
    Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as "apostates"
    who are "mentally diseased".
  question: Who do Jehovah's Witnesses believe introduced independent thinking?
- answer: hyperphagic and obese
  context: Mutations or deletions of clock gene in mice have demonstrated the importance
    of body clocks to ensure the proper timing of cellular/metabolic events; clock-mutant
    mice are hyperphagic and obese, and have altered glucose metabolism. In mice,
    deletion of the Rev-ErbA alpha clock gene facilitates diet-induced obesity and
    changes the balance between glucose and lipid utilization predisposing to diabetes.
    However, it is not clear whether there is a strong association between clock gene
    polymorphisms in humans and the susceptibility to develop the metabolic syndrome.
  question: What do mice without the clock gene become?
- answer: '1997'
  context: "Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher\
    \ costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households;\
    \ this changed when the company\u2019s Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997.\
    \ While the industry\u2019s average selling price to individuals was going down,\
    \ Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful\
    \ computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were\
    \ choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked\
    \ the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having\
    \ it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing\
    \ group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed\
    \ especially for individual users."
  question: When did Dell create their internal marketing group?
- answer: 40,000 miles
  context: From Elizabeth's birth onwards, the British Empire continued its transformation
    into the Commonwealth of Nations. By the time of her accession in 1952, her role
    as head of multiple independent states was already established. In 1953, the Queen
    and her husband embarked on a seven-month round-the-world tour, visiting 13 countries
    and covering more than 40,000 miles by land, sea and air. She became the first
    reigning monarch of Australia and New Zealand to visit those nations. During the
    tour, crowds were immense; three-quarters of the population of Australia were
    estimated to have seen her. Throughout her reign, the Queen has made hundreds
    of state visits to other countries and tours of the Commonwealth; she is the most
    widely travelled head of state.
  question: How many miles did Elizabeth cover on her world tour?
- answer: princes, prelates
  context: The original Latin word "universitas" refers in general to "a number of
    persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild, corporation,
    etc." At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds, specialised
    "associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed
    by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located"
    came to be denominated by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating
    and determined the qualifications of their members.
  question: Which individuals usually approved charters for universitas?
- answer: lungs
  context: Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by the bacterium
    Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but
    can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms,
    known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active
    disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic
    symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever,
    night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term "consumption" came about due
    to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.
  question: What primary body part is affected by tuberculosis?
- answer: shells, bones, and spicules
  context: 'All animals have eukaryotic cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular
    matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins. This may be calcified to
    form structures like shells, bones, and spicules. During development, it forms
    a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized,
    making complex structures possible. In contrast, other multicellular organisms,
    like plants and fungi, have cells held in place by cell walls, and so develop
    by progressive growth. Also, unique to animal cells are the following intercellular
    junctions: tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.'
  question: What is formed when the collagen and elastic glycoproteins surrounding
    eukaryotic cells are calcified?
- answer: Ancient Greece
  context: By the mid 18th century, the movement broadened to incorporate a greater
    range of Classical influences, including those from Ancient Greece. The shift
    to neoclassical architecture is conventionally dated to the 1750s. It first gained
    influence in England and France; in England, Sir William Hamilton's excavations
    at Pompeii and other sites, the influence of the Grand Tour and the work of William
    Chambers and Robert Adam, was pivotal in this regard. In France, the movement
    was propelled by a generation of French art students trained in Rome, and was
    influenced by the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann. The style was also adopted
    by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia.
  question: What additional influences were incorporated into neoclassical architecture
    by mid 18th century?
- answer: Bellevue Hospital
  context: The most well-known hospital in the HHC system is Bellevue Hospital, the
    oldest public hospital in the United States. Bellevue is the designated hospital
    for treatment of the President of the United States and other world leaders if
    they become sick or injured while in New York City. The president of HHC is Ramanathan
    Raju, MD, a surgeon and former CEO of the Cook County health system in Illinois.
  question: If the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom becomes sick in New York City,
    what hospital does he go to?
- answer: biologically-based
  context: Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they
    believe that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental
    influences. They favor biologically-based theories, which point to genetic factors,
    the early uterine environment, both, or the inclusion of genetic and social factors.
    There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences
    play a role when it comes to sexual orientation. Research over several decades
    has demonstrated that sexual orientation ranges along a continuum, from exclusive
    attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex.
  question: What is the favored influence as to the cause of sexual orientation?
- answer: '1986'
  context: "Olin has a network of more than 16,000 alumni worldwide. Over the last\
    \ several years, the school\u2019s endowment has increased to $213 million (2004)\
    \ and annual gifts average $12 million per year.[citation needed] Simon Hall was\
    \ opened in 1986 after a donation from John E. Simon. On May 2, 2014, the $90\

    \ gift from Charles F. Knight and Joanne Knight and a $10 million gift from George\
    \ and Carol Bauer through the Bauer Foundation."
  question: When was Simon Hall opened?
- answer: Clinton Bush Haiti Fund
  context: "In 2011, documents obtained by WikiLeaks revealed that Beyonc\xE9 was\
    \ one of many entertainers who performed for the family of Libyan ruler Muammar\
    \ Gaddafi. Rolling Stone reported that the music industry was urging them to return\
    \ the money they earned for the concerts; a spokesperson for Beyonc\xE9 later\
    \ confirmed to The Huffington Post that she donated the money to the Clinton Bush\
    \ Haiti Fund. Later that year she became the first solo female artist to headline\
    \ the main Pyramid stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival in over twenty years,\
    \ and was named the highest-paid performer in the world per minute."
  question: Who did Beyonce donate the money to earned from her shows?
- answer: the inelastic exoskeleton
  context: "The life cycles of insects vary but most hatch from eggs. Insect growth\
    \ is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series\
    \ of molts. The immature stages can differ from the adults in structure, habit\
    \ and habitat, and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo\
    \ 4-stage metamorphosis (see holometabolism). Insects that undergo 3-stage metamorphosis\
    \ lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of nymphal stages. The\
    \ higher level relationship of the Hexapoda is unclear. Fossilized insects of\
    \ enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era, including giant dragonflies\
    \ with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm (22\u201328 in). The most diverse insect groups\
    \ appear to have coevolved with flowering plants."
  question: Insects growth is constrained by what?
- answer: Jerusalem
  context: The Crusaders in the Holy Land also adopted mosaic decoration under local
    Byzantine influence. During their 12th-century reconstruction of the Church of
    the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics
    with new ones. Almost nothing of them survived except the "Ascension of Christ"
    in the Latin Chapel (now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics).
    More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration
    of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The mosaics in the nave are arranged
    in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ, Councils
    of the Church and angels. In the apses the Annunciation, the Nativity, Adoration
    of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen. The program of redecoration
    of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine
    emperor, the king of Jerusalem and the Latin Church.
  question: Where is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre located?
- answer: Decca Records
  context: Thomas Newman returned as Spectre's composer. Rather than composing the
    score once the film had moved into post-production, Newman worked during filming.
    The theatrical trailer released in July 2015 contained a rendition of John Barry's
    On Her Majesty's Secret Service theme. Mendes revealed that the final film would
    have more than one hundred minutes of music. The soundtrack album was released
    on 23 October 2015 in the UK and 6 November 2015 in the USA on the Decca Records
    label.
  question: What company published the Spectre soundtrack?
- answer: the Emirates Cup, Teresa Herrera Trophy and the Amsterdam Tournament
  context: Since the introduction of league football, most club sides play a number
    of friendlies before the start of each season (called pre-season friendlies).
    Friendly football matches are considered to be non-competitive and are only used
    to "warm up" players for a new season/competitive match. There is generally nothing
    competitive at stake and some rules may be changed or experimented with (such
    as unlimited substitutions, which allow teams to play younger, less experienced,
    players, and no cards). Although most friendlies are simply one-off matches arranged
    by the clubs themselves, in which a certain amount is paid by the challenger club
    to the incumbent club, some teams do compete in short tournaments, such as the
    Emirates Cup, Teresa Herrera Trophy and the Amsterdam Tournament. Although these
    events may involve sponsorship deals and the awarding of a trophy and may even
    be broadcast on television, there is little prestige attached to them.
  question: What are some examples of friendly short football tournaments?
- answer: '1337'
  context: "Throughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence\
    \ at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties\
    \ when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern\
    \ France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in\
    \ the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327\u201377) and his son Edward, the\
    \ Black Prince (d. 1376),[AF] won the battles of Cr\xE9cy and Poitiers, captured\
    \ the city of Calais, and won control of much of France.[AG] The resulting stresses\
    \ almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years\
    \ of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving,\
    \ but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to\
    \ the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in\
    \ southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at\
    \ the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict.\
    \ Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing\
    \ much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The\
    \ conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate\
    \ from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence. The dominance\
    \ of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War,\
    \ and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Cr\xE9cy in 1346."
  question: When did the Hundred Years' War begin?
- answer: Schadenfreude
  context: The history of emotions has become an increasingly popular topic recently,
    with some scholars arguing that it is an essential category of analysis, not unlike
    class, race, or gender. Historians, like other social scientists, assume that
    emotions, feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both
    different cultures and different historical times, and constructivist school of
    history claims even that some sentiments and meta-emotions, for example Schadenfreude,
    are learnt and not only regulated by culture. Historians of emotion trace and
    analyse the changing norms and rules of feeling, while examining emotional regimes,
    codes, and lexicons from social, cultural or political history perspectives. Others
    focus on the history of medicine, science or psychology. What somebody can and
    may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends
    on social norms and rules. It is thus historically variable and open to change.
    Several research centers have opened in the past few years in Germany, England,
    Spain, Sweden and Australia.
  question: According to the constructivists, what is an example of a learned meta-emotion?
- answer: '10'
  context: The Classical era, from about 1750 to 1820, established many of the norms
    of composition, presentation, and style, and was also when the piano became the
    predominant keyboard instrument. The basic forces required for an orchestra became
    somewhat standardized (although they would grow as the potential of a wider array
    of instruments was developed in the following centuries). Chamber music grew to
    include ensembles with as many as 8 to 10 performers for serenades. Opera continued
    to develop, with regional styles in Italy, France, and German-speaking lands.
    The opera buffa, a form of comic opera, rose in popularity. The symphony came
    into its own as a musical form, and the concerto was developed as a vehicle for
    displays of virtuoso playing skill. Orchestras no longer required a harpsichord
    (which had been part of the traditional continuo in the Baroque style), and were
    often led by the lead violinist (now called the concertmaster).
  question: How many muscians, at most, could make up a chamber ensemble during the
    classical period?
- answer: melodies
  context: "She has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with\
    \ Destiny's Child and her solo efforts. Her early songs were personally driven\
    \ and female-empowerment themed compositions like \"Independent Women\" and \"\
    Survivor\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay Z she transitioned\
    \ to more man-tending anthems such as \"Cater 2 U\". Beyonc\xE9 has also received\
    \ co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved,\
    \ especially during her solo efforts. However, she does not formulate beats herself,\
    \ but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production, sharing them\
    \ with producers."
  question: What part of production does she do?
- answer: '2000'
  context: Residents of Oklahoma City suffered substantial losses on April 19, 1995
    when Timothy McVeigh detonated a bomb in front of the Murrah building. The building
    was destroyed (the remnants of which had to be imploded in a controlled demolition
    later that year), more than 100 nearby buildings suffered severe damage, and 168
    people were killed. The site has been commemorated as the Oklahoma City National
    Memorial and Museum. Since its opening in 2000, over three million people have
    visited. Every year on April 19, survivors, families and friends return to the
    memorial to read the names of each person lost.
  question: What year did the memorial first opened?
- answer: a motor mechanic utilizing a system of toothed wheels
  context: In 1845, the Neapolitan architect Gaetano Genovese installed in the Royal
    Palace of Caserta the "Flying Chair", an elevator ahead of its time, covered with
    chestnut wood outside and with maple wood inside. It included a light, two benches
    and a hand operated signal, and could be activated from the outside, without any
    effort on the part of the occupants. Traction was controlled by a motor mechanic
    utilizing a system of toothed wheels. A safety system was designed to take effect
    if the cords broke. It consisted of a beam pushed outwards by a steel spring.
  question: What controlled the traction?
- answer: Isma'il ibn Jafar
  context: "The Ismailis differ from Twelvers because they had living imams for centuries\
    \ after the last Twelver Imam went into concealment. They followed Isma'il ibn\
    \ Jafar, elder brother of Musa al-Kadhim, as the rightful Imam after his father\
    \ Ja'far al-Sadiq. The Ismailis believe that whether Imam Ismail did or did not\
    \ die before Imam Ja'far, he had passed on the mantle of the imamate to his son\
    \ Mu\u1E25ammad ibn Ismail as the next imam. Thus, their line of imams is as follows\
    \ (the years of their individual imamats during the Common Era are given in brackets):"
  question: Who is the elder brother of Musa al-Kadhim?
- answer: solidarity
  context: Representatives from indigenous and rural organizations from major South
    American countries, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, started
    a forum in support of Morales' legal process of change. The meeting condemned
    plans by the European "foreign power elite" to destabilize the country. The forum
    also expressed solidarity with the Morales and his economic and social changes
    in the interest of historically marginalized majorities. Furthermore, in a cathartic
    blow to the US-backed elite, it questioned US interference through diplomats and
    NGOs. The forum was suspicious of plots against Bolivia and other countries, including
    Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay and Nicaragua.
  question: What did the forum express for Morales and his proposed changes?
- answer: '1908'
  context: The Guangxu Emperor died on November 14, 1908, and on November 15, 1908,
    Cixi also died. Rumors held that she or Yuan Shikai ordered trusted eunuchs to
    poison the Guangxu Emperor, and an autopsy conducted nearly a century later confirmed
    lethal levels of arsenic in his corpse. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince
    Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at
    the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal
    of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng
    created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet
    was also known by contemporaries as "The Royal Cabinet" because among the thirteen
    cabinet members, five were members of the imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives.
    This brought a wide range of negative opinions from senior officials like Zhang
    Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911, led to the creation of a new
    central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen as its
    provisional head. Many provinces soon began "separating" from Qing control. Seeing
    a desperate situation unfold, the Qing government brought Yuan Shikai back to
    military power. He took control of his Beiyang Army to crush the revolution in
    Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After taking the position of Prime Minister and
    creating his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai went as far as to ask for the removal of
    Zaifeng from the regency. This removal later proceeded with directions from Empress
    Dowager Longyu.
  question: What year did Cixi die?
- answer: '1960'
  context: Eisenhower told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model
    for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children.
    He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960 and signed those
    acts into law. The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights
    office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony
    about abuses of voting rights. Although both acts were much weaker than subsequent
    civil rights legislation, they constituted the first significant civil rights
    acts since 1875.
  question: In what year did Eisenhower propose his second civil rights act?
- answer: 430,600
  context: At the 2009 American Community Survey, Black Americans made the second
    largest group in the Bronx after Hispanics and Latinos. Blacks of both Hispanic
    and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-third (35.4%) of the Bronx's population.
    Blacks of non-Hispanic origin made up 30.8% of the population. Over 495,200 blacks
    resided in the borough, of which 430,600 were non-Hispanic blacks. Over 61,000
    people identified themselves as "Sub-Saharan African" in the survey, making up
    4.4% of the population.
  question: How many people in the Bronx are black (not including Hispanic)?
- answer: Student Union Activities
  context: "The first union was built on campus in 1926 as a campus community center.\
    \ The unions are still the \"living rooms\" of campus today and include three\
    \ locations \u2013 the Kansas Union and Burge Union at the Lawrence Campus and\
    \ Jayhawk Central at the Edwards Campus. The KU Memorial Unions Corporation manages\
    \ the KU Bookstore (with seven locations). The KU Bookstore is the official bookstore\
    \ of KU. The Corporation also includes KU Dining Services, with more than 20 campus\
    \ locations, including The Market (inside the Kansas Union) and The Underground\
    \ (located in Wescoe Hall). The KU Bookstore and KU Dining Services are not-for-profit,\
    \ with proceeds going back to support student programs, such as Student Union\
    \ Activities."
  question: What is the name of a potential recipient of funds from enterprises like
    the bookstore and dining centers at KU?
- answer: "\xC1lvaro de Menda\xF1a"
  context: "In 1568, Spanish navigator \xC1lvaro de Menda\xF1a was the first European\
    \ to sail through the archipelago, sighting the island of Nui during his expedition\
    \ in search of Terra Australis. In 1819 the island of Funafuti was named Ellice's\
    \ Island; the name Ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of English\
    \ hydrographer Alexander George Findlay. The islands came under Britain's sphere\
    \ of influence in the late 19th century, when each of the Ellice Islands was declared\
    \ a British Protectorate by Captain Gibson of HMS Curacoa between 9 and 16 October\
    \ 1892. The Ellice Islands were administered as British protectorate by a Resident\
    \ Commissioner from 1892 to 1916 as part of the British Western Pacific Territories\
    \ (BWPT), and then as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony from 1916\
    \ to 1974."
  question: Who was the discoverer of Tuvalu?
- answer: A Day at the Races
  context: By 1976, Queen were back in the studio recording A Day at the Races, which
    is often regarded as a sequel album to A Night at the Opera. It again borrowed
    the name of a Marx Brothers movie, and its cover was similar to that of A Night
    at the Opera, a variation on the same Queen Crest. The most recognisable of the
    Marx Brothers, Groucho Marx, invited Queen to visit him in his Los Angeles home
    in March 1977; there the band thanked him in person, and performed "'39" a cappella.
    Musically, A Day at the Races was by both fans' and critics' standards a strong
    effort, reaching number one in the UK and Japan, and number five in the US. The
    major hit on the album was "Somebody to Love", a gospel-inspired song in which
    Mercury, May, and Taylor multi-tracked their voices to create a 100-voice gospel
    choir. The song went to number two in the UK, and number thirteen in the US. The
    album also featured one of the band's heaviest songs, May's "Tie Your Mother Down",
    which became a staple of their live shows.
  question: What Queen album was released in 1976?
- answer: from 1,600 to 2,400 m
  context: The Alps are split into five climatic zones, each with different vegetation.
    The climate, plant life and animal life vary among the different sections or zones
    of the mountains. The lowest zone is the colline zone, which exists between 500
    and 1,000 m (1,640 and 3,281 ft), depending on the location. The montane zone
    extends from 800 to 1,700 m (2,625 to 5,577 ft), followed by the sub-Alpine zone
    from 1,600 to 2,400 m (5,249 to 7,874 ft). The Alpine zone, extending from tree
    line to snow line, is followed by the glacial zone, which covers the glaciated
    areas of the mountain. Climatic conditions show variances within the same zones;
    for example, weather conditions at the head of a mountain valley, extending directly
    from the peaks, are colder and more severe than those at the mouth of a valley
    which tend to be less severe and receive less snowfall.
  question: Where does the sub-Alpine zone extend from?
- answer: Amoy Hokkien
  context: Hokkien originated from Quanzhou. After the Opium War in 1842, Xiamen (Amoy)
    became one of the major treaty ports to be opened for trade with the outside world.
    From mid-19th century onwards, Xiamen slowly developed to become the political
    and economical center of the Hokkien-speaking region in China. This caused Amoy
    dialect to gradually replace the position of dialect variants from Quanzhou and
    Zhangzhou. From mid-19th century until the end of World War II, western diplomats
    usually learned Amoy Hokkien as the preferred dialect if they were to communicate
    with the Hokkien-speaking populace in China or South-East Asia. In the 1940s and
    1950s, Taiwan also held Amoy Hokkien as its standard and tended to incline itself
    towards Amoy dialect.
  question: What dialect did western diplomats learn to communicate with the Hokkien
    speaking people in China?
- answer: 55%
  context: "The product claimed to be the strongest beer made is Schorschbr\xE4u's\
    \ 2011 Schorschbock 57 with 57,5%. It was preceded by The End of History, a 55%\
    \ Belgian ale, made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had previously made Sink\
    \ The Bismarck!, a 41% abv IPA, and Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a 32% abv Imperial\
    \ stout. Each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing,\
    \ in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed,\
    \ until the desired strength is reached, a process that may class the product\
    \ as spirits rather than beer. The German brewery Schorschbr\xE4u's Schorschbock,\
    \ a 31% abv eisbock, and Hair of the Dog's Dave, a 29% abv barley wine made in\
    \ 1994, used the same fractional freezing method. A 60% abv blend of beer with\
    \ whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a Dutch brewery in July\
    \ 2010."
  question: How much alcohol was in The End of History beer?
- answer: traders and fur trappers
  context: Interracial relationships have had a long history in North America and
    the United States, beginning with the intermixing of European explorers and soldiers,
    who took native women as companions. After European settlement increased, traders
    and fur trappers often married or had unions with women of native tribes. In the
    17th century, faced with a continuing, critical labor shortage, colonists primarily
    in the Chesapeake Bay Colony, imported Africans as laborers, sometimes as indentured
    servants and, increasingly, as slaves. African slaves were also imported into
    New York and other northern ports by the Dutch and later English. Some African
    slaves were freed by their masters during these early years.
  question: Who started marrying or having unions with native women after settlment
    increased?
- answer: the Old Swiss Confederacy
  context: "The English name Switzerland is a compound containing Switzer, an obsolete\
    \ term for the Swiss, which was in use during the 16th to 19th centuries. The\
    \ English adjective Swiss is a loan from French Suisse, also in use since the\
    \ 16th century. The name Switzer is from the Alemannic Schwiizer, in origin an\
    \ inhabitant of Schwyz and its associated territory, one of the Waldst\xE4tten\
    \ cantons which formed the nucleus of the Old Swiss Confederacy. The name originates\
    \ as an exonym, applied pars pro toto to the troops of the Confederacy. The Swiss\
    \ began to adopt the name for themselves after the Swabian War of 1499, used alongside\
    \ the term for \"Confederates\", Eidgenossen (literally: comrades by oath), used\
    \ since the 14th century."
  question: What did the Alemannic Schwiizer help form the nucleus of?
- answer: distinct and discrete
  context: 'A second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of
    relations. It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects.
    Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related
    to other things. The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as
    being fundamentally separate in time and space, and not necessarily related to
    anything. But in Whitehead''s view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even
    more important than the relata themselves. A student taking notes in one of Whitehead''s
    fall 1924 classes wrote that:'
  question: What does Materialism see each object as?
- answer: Li Zicheng
  context: "The dynasty was founded by the Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria.\
    \ In the late sixteenth century, Nurhaci, originally a Ming vassal, began organizing\
    \ Jurchen clans into \"Banners\", military-social units. Nurhaci formed these\
    \ clans into a unified entity, the subjects of which became known collectively\
    \ as the Manchu people. By 1636, his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces\
    \ out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty, the Qing. In 1644, peasant rebels\
    \ led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital Beijing. Rather than serve them,\
    \ Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai\
    \ Pass to the Banner Armies led by Prince Dorgon, who defeated the rebels and\
    \ seized Beijing. The conquest of China proper was not completed until 1683 under\
    \ the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661\u20131722). The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong\
    \ Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Central Asia.\
    \ While the early rulers maintained their Manchu ways, and while their official\
    \ title was Emperor they were known as khans to the Mongols and patronized Tibetan\
    \ Buddhism, they governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic\
    \ government. They retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to\
    \ work under or in parallel with Manchus. They also adapted the ideals of the\
    \ tributary system in international relations, and in places such as Taiwan, the\
    \ Qing so-called internal foreign policy closely resembled colonial policy and\
    \ control."
  question: Name a peasant rebel leader?
- answer: greater
  context: The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render
    it softer and more pliable. A similar effect of common observation is in the softening
    action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater
    the water content, the greater its softening effect.
  question: When water content increases within certain limits in wood, does is have
    a less or greater softening effect?
- answer: "Mus\xE9e d'Art et d'Histoire"
  context: "In the 1770s Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker, built a mechanical\
    \ doll (automata) that could write holding a quill pen. By switching the number\
    \ and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different messages,\
    \ could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically \"programmed\" to read\
    \ instructions. Along with two other complex machines, the doll is at the Mus\xE9\
    e d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuch\xE2tel, Switzerland, and still operates."
  question: Where is the doll Pierre Jaquet-Droz built today?
- answer: '2006'
  context: The number of shootings in the city has declined significantly in the last
    10 years. Shooting incidents peaked in 2006 when 1,857 shootings were recorded.
    That number has dropped 44 percent to 1,047 shootings in 2014. Similarly, major
    crimes in the city has decreased gradually in the last ten years since its peak
    in 2006 when 85,498 major crimes were reported. In the past three years, the number
    of reported major crimes fell 11 percent to a total of 68,815. Violent crimes,
    which include homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery, decreased 14 percent
    in the past three years with a reported 15,771 occurrences in 2014. Based on the
    rate of violent crimes per 1,000 residents in American cities with 25,000 people
    or more, Philadelphia was ranked as the 54th most dangerous city in 2015.
  question: When did shootings peak in the city?
- answer: the defending champions
  context: "An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005,\
    \ after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish\
    \ in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season.\
    \ UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League,\
    \ giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions\
    \ qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic\
    \ league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions\
    \ League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the\
    \ top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed\
    \ team in the league. No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions\
    \ League. This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea \u2013 who had won the Champions\
    \ League the previous year, but finished sixth in the league \u2013 qualified\
    \ for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa\
    \ League."
  question: Who did UEFA rule should automatically qualify for the Champions League?
- answer: composted yard waste
  context: Alternatives to pesticides are available and include methods of cultivation,
    use of biological pest controls (such as pheromones and microbial pesticides),
    genetic engineering, and methods of interfering with insect breeding. Application
    of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests. These
    methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional
    chemical pesticides. In addition, EPA is registering reduced-risk conventional
    pesticides in increasing numbers.
  question: What natural product can be used to control pests?
- answer: James Hutton
  context: "The Protestant Reformation inspired a literal interpretation of the Bible,\
    \ with concepts of creation that conflicted with the findings of an emerging science\
    \ seeking explanations congruent with the mechanical philosophy of Ren\xE9 Descartes\
    \ and the empiricism of the Baconian method. After the turmoil of the English\
    \ Civil War, the Royal Society wanted to show that science did not threaten religious\
    \ and political stability. John Ray developed an influential natural theology\
    \ of rational order; in his taxonomy, species were static and fixed, their adaptation\
    \ and complexity designed by God, and varieties showed minor differences caused\
    \ by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully\
    \ swift death, but the suffering caused by parasitism was a puzzling problem.\
    \ The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed\
    \ species as fixed according to the divine plan. In 1766, Georges Buffon suggested\
    \ that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards,\
    \ might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The Ussher chronology of\
    \ the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004 BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed\
    \ a much older world. Wernerians thought strata were deposits from shrinking seas,\
    \ but James Hutton proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating uniformitarianism."
  question: Who proposed that life is a self-maintaining, infinite cycle?
- answer: George of Cappadocia
  context: Through the influence of the Eusebian faction at Constantinople, an Arian
    bishop, George of Cappadocia, was now appointed to rule the see of Alexandria.
    Athanasius, after remaining some days in the neighbourhood of the city, finally
    withdrew into the desert of Upper Egypt, where he remained for a period of six
    years, living the life of the monks, devoting himself to the composition of a
    group of writings; "Apology to Constantius", the "Apology for his Flight", the
    "Letter to the Monks", and the "History of the Arians".
  question: Who took over after Athanasius?
- answer: decline in the local economy
  context: Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands
    of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city
    officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed
    the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially
    supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests
    that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic
    power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid
    a decline in the local economy.
  question: What has been the effect of Yale and New Haven's relation on New Haven?
- answer: Basel
  context: 'Critics such as economist Paul Krugman and U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
    Geithner have argued that the regulatory framework did not keep pace with financial
    innovation, such as the increasing importance of the shadow banking system, derivatives
    and off-balance sheet financing. A recent OECD study suggest that bank regulation
    based on the Basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed
    to or even reinforced the financial crisis. In other cases, laws were changed
    or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system. Key examples include:'
  question: What accords possibly contributed to or reinforced the financial crisis?
- answer: 154 GW
  context: Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in
    the 1890s. These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually
    replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. As with photovoltaics, solar
    water heating attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the
    1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development
    in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and
    growth rates have averaged 20% per year since 1999. Although generally underestimated,
    solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology
    with an estimated capacity of 154 GW as of 2007.
  question: What was the estimated capacity of solar water heating and cooling in
    2007?
- answer: Rouget de Lisle
  context: 'The red flag appeared as a political symbol during the French Revolution,
    after the fall of Bastille. A law adopted by the new government on October 20,
    1789 authorized the Garde Nationale to raise the red flag in the event of a riot,
    to signal that the Garde would imminently intervene. During a demonstration on
    the Champs de Mars on July 17, 1791, the Garde Nationale fired on the crowd, killed
    up to fifty people. The government was denounced by the more radical revolutionaries.
    In the words of his famous hymn, the Marseillaise, Rouget de Lisle wrote: "Against
    us they have raised the bloody flag of tyranny!" (Contre nous de la tyrannie,
    l''entendard sanglant est leve). Beginning in 1790, the most radical revolutionaries
    adopted the red flag themselves, to symbolize the blood of those killed in the
    demonstrations, and to call for the repression of those they considered counter-revolutionary.'
  question: Who wrote the words "Against us they have raised the bloody flag of tyranny?"
- answer: surface-mount device (SMD)
  context: Discrete transistors are individually packaged transistors. Transistors
    come in many different semiconductor packages (see image). The two main categories
    are through-hole (or leaded), and surface-mount, also known as surface-mount device
    (SMD). The ball grid array (BGA) is the latest surface-mount package (currently
    only for large integrated circuits). It has solder "balls" on the underside in
    place of leads. Because they are smaller and have shorter interconnections, SMDs
    have better high-frequency characteristics but lower power rating.
  question: What is another name for the surface-mount transistor?
- answer: Napoleon Bonaparte
  context: "After a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the\
    \ Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive\
    \ solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city\
    \ limits. Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of P\xE8re Lachaise, Montmartre,\
    \ Montparnasse, and later Passy; these cemeteries became inner-city once again\
    \ when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger\
    \ ring of suburban fortifications in 1860. New suburban cemeteries were created\
    \ in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimeti\xE8re parisien\
    \ de Saint-Ouen, the Cimeti\xE8re parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimeti\xE8\
    re parisien de Pantin-Bobigny, the Cimeti\xE8re parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimeti\xE8\
    re parisien de Bagneux).[citation needed] Some of the most famous people in the\
    \ world are buried in Parisian cemeteries."
  question: Who was Prefect Nicholas Frochot under?
- answer: Arabic
  context: "Indian astronomer and mathematician Aryabhata (476-550), in his Aryabhatiya\
    \ (499) introduced a number of trigonometric functions (including sine, versine,\
    \ cosine and inverse sine), trigonometric tables, and techniques and algorithms\
    \ of algebra. In 628 AD, Brahmagupta suggested that gravity was a force of attraction.\
    \ He also lucidly explained the use of zero as both a placeholder and a decimal\
    \ digit, along with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system now used universally throughout\
    \ the world. Arabic translations of the two astronomers' texts were soon available\
    \ in the Islamic world, introducing what would become Arabic numerals to the Islamic\
    \ World by the 9th century. During the 14th\u201316th centuries, the Kerala school\
    \ of astronomy and mathematics made significant advances in astronomy and especially\
    \ mathematics, including fields such as trigonometry and analysis. In particular,\
    \ Madhava of Sangamagrama is considered the \"founder of mathematical analysis\"\
    ."
  question: What language did the work of Brahmagupta and Aryabhata have to be translated
    from?
- answer: Christ
  context: "Sometimes not only church interiors but fa\xE7ades were also decorated\
    \ with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the St Mark's Basilica in Venice (mainly\
    \ from the 17th\u201319th centuries, but the oldest one from 1270\u201375, \"\
    The burial of St Mark in the first basilica\"), the Cathedral of Orvieto (golden\
    \ Gothic mosaics from the 14th century, many times redone) and the Basilica di\
    \ San Frediano in Lucca (huge, striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension\
    \ of Christ with the apostles below, designed by Berlinghiero Berlinghieri in\
    \ the 13th century). The Cathedral of Spoleto is also decorated on the upper fa\xE7\

    \ from 1207)."
  question: the Basilica di San Frediano in Lucca has a large golden mosaic facade
    depicting which figure?
- answer: hiding or overlooking the nation's Black, Indigenous, Multiracial and East
    Asian populations.
  context: Critics note that people of color have limited media visibility. The Brazilian
    media has been accused of hiding or overlooking the nation's Black, Indigenous,
    Multiracial and East Asian populations. For example, the telenovelas or soaps
    are criticized for featuring actors who resemble northern Europeans rather than
    actors of the more prevalent Southern European features) and light-skinned mulatto
    and mestizo appearance. (Pardos may achieve "white" status if they have attained
    the middle-class or higher social status).
  question: What has the Brazilian media been accused of?
- answer: more brilliant
  context: Cotton lisle is a finely-spun, tightly twisted type of cotton that is noted
    for being strong and durable. Lisle is composed of two strands that have each
    been twisted an extra twist per inch than ordinary yarns and combined to create
    a single thread. The yarn is spun so that it is compact and solid. This cotton
    is used mainly for underwear, stockings, and gloves. Colors applied to this yarn
    are noted for being more brilliant than colors applied to softer yarn. This type
    of thread was first made in the city of Lisle, France (now Lille), hence its name.
  question: How is color perceived to be for lisle in comparison to softer yarns?
- answer: Opera Plaza
  context: On October 17, 1987, about 3,000 Armenians demonstrated in Yerevan complaining
    about the condition of Lake Sevan, the Nairit chemicals plant, and the Metsamor
    Nuclear Power Plant, and air pollution in Yerevan. Police tried to prevent the
    protest but took no action to stop it once the march was underway. The demonstration
    was led by Armenian writers such as Silva Kaputikian, Zori Balayan, and Maro Margarian
    and leaders from the National Survival organization. The march originated at the
    Opera Plaza after speakers, mainly intellectuals, addressed the crowd.
  question: Where did the protest march start?
- answer: became a spy for Germany in both World Wars
  context: The most famous escapee was the Boer prisoner of war Captain Fritz Joubert
    Duquesne who was serving a life sentence for "conspiracy against the British government
    and on (the charge of) espionage.". On the night of 25 June 1902, Duquesne slipped
    out of his tent, worked his way over a barbed-wire fence, swam 1.5 miles (2.4
    km) past patrol boats and bright spot lights, through storm-wracked, shark infested
    waters, using a distant lighthouse for navigation until he arrived ashore on the
    main island. From there he escaped to the port of St. George's and a week later,
    he stowed away on a boat heading to Baltimore, Maryland. He settled in the US
    and later became a spy for Germany in both World Wars. In 1942, Col. Duquesne
    was arrested by the FBI for leading the Duquesne Spy Ring, which still to this
    day the largest espionage case in the history of the United States.
  question: After settling in the US, what did Duquesne do?
- answer: During the 1970s and 1990s
  context: Sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist
    and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies.
    During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist
    traditions that had largely informed the discipline.[page needed] During this
    shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to
    occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology
    and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference
    in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over
    the last several decades.
  question: When was there an epistemological shift away from positivist traditions
    in anthropology?
- answer: California
  context: "On the morning of 11 September 2001, 19 men affiliated with al-Qaeda hijacked\
    \ four airliners all bound for California. Once the hijackers assumed control\
    \ of the airliners, they told the passengers that they had the bomb on board and\
    \ would spare the lives of passengers and crew once their demands were met \u2013\
    \ no passenger and crew actually suspected that they would use the airliners as\
    \ suicide weapons since it had never happened before in history. The hijackers\
    \ \u2013 members of al-Qaeda's Hamburg cell \u2013 intentionally crashed two airliners\
    \ into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Both buildings\
    \ collapsed within two hours from fire damage related to the crashes, destroying\
    \ nearby buildings and damaging others. The hijackers crashed a third airliner\
    \ into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, just outside Washington D.C.\
    \ The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after\
    \ some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane,\
    \ which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington D.C., to target the White\
    \ House, or the U.S. Capitol. No flights had survivors. A total of 2,977 victims\
    \ and the 19 hijackers perished in the attacks."
  question: Where were the 9/11 planes originally going?
- answer: Great Britain
  context: One such institution is the Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents (CSAD)
    founded by and located centrally at Oxford University, Great Britain. Among its
    many activities CSAD numbers "a long-term project to create a library of digitised
    images of Greek inscriptions." These it arranges by region. The Egypt and the
    Near East region besides Egypt includes Cyprus, Persia and Afghanistan but not
    Asia Minor (a separate region).
  question: Where is Oxford University?
- answer: aluminium
  context: "Like aluminium, copper is 100% recyclable without any loss of quality,\
    \ regardless of whether it is in a raw state or contained in a manufactured product.\
    \ In volume, copper is the third most recycled metal after iron and aluminium.\
    \ It is estimated that 80% of the copper ever mined is still in use today. According\
    \ to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global\
    \ per capita stock of copper in use in society is 35\u201355 kg. Much of this\
    \ is in more-developed countries (140\u2013300 kg per capita) rather than less-developed\
    \ countries (30\u201340 kg per capita)."
  question: What other metal besides copper is 100% recyclable?
- answer: more than 20 million
  context: The rivalry between Nintendo and Sega resulted in what has been described
    as one of the most notable console wars in video game history, in which Sega positioned
    the Genesis as the "cool" console, with more mature titles aimed at older gamers,
    and edgy advertisements that occasionally attacked the competition. Nintendo however,
    scored an early public relations advantage by securing the first console conversion
    of Capcom's arcade classic Street Fighter II for SNES, which took over a year
    to make the transition to Genesis. Despite the Genesis's head start, much larger
    library of games, and lower price point, the Genesis only represented an estimated
    60% of the American 16-bit console market in June 1992, and neither console could
    maintain a definitive lead for several years. Donkey Kong Country is said to have
    helped establish the SNES's market prominence in the latter years of the 16-bit
    generation, and for a time, maintain against the PlayStation and Saturn. According
    to Nintendo, the company had sold more than 20 million SNES units in the U.S.
    According to a 2014 Wedbush Securities report based on NPD sales data, the SNES
    ultimately outsold the Genesis in the U.S. market.
  question: How many SNES units were sold in the US overall?
- answer: disputed islands and dotted lines marking China's maritime claims
  context: "Prior to the rally, seven anti-China protestors were arrested in Hanoi\
    \ after unfurling a banner and shouting \"Boycott the Beijing Olympics\" through\
    \ a loudhailer at a market. A Vietnamese American was deported for planning protests\
    \ against the torch, while a prominent blogger, \u0110i\u1EBFu C\xE0y (real name\
    \ Nguy\u1EC5n V\u0103n H\u1EA3i), who blogged about protests around the world\
    \ and who called for demonstrations in Vietnam, was arrested on charges of tax\
    \ evasion. Outside Vietnam, there were protests by overseas Vietnamese in Paris,\
    \ San Francisco and Canberra. L\xEA Minh Phi\u1EBFu, a torchbearer who is a Vietnamese\
    \ law student studying in France, wrote a letter to the president of the International\
    \ Olympic Committee protesting China's \"politicisation of the Olympics\", citing\
    \ maps of the torch relay at the official Beijing Olympic website depicting the\
    \ disputed islands as Chinese territory and posted it on his blog. One day before\
    \ the relay was to start, the official website appeared to have been updated to\
    \ remove the disputed islands and dotted lines marking China's maritime claims\
    \ in the South China Sea."
  question: "What was removed from the website that L\xEA Minh Phi\u1EBFu had written\
    \ about?"
- answer: the Northern Crusades
  context: The Estonian literature refers to literature written in the Estonian language
    (ca. 1 million speakers). The domination of Estonia after the Northern Crusades,
    from the 13th century to 1918 by Germany, Sweden, and Russia resulted in few early
    written literary works in the Estonian language. The oldest records of written
    Estonian date from the 13th century. Originates Livoniae in Chronicle of Henry
    of Livonia contains Estonian place names, words and fragments of sentences. The
    Liber Census Daniae (1241) contains Estonian place and family names.
  question: What event preceded the domination of Estonia by different European powers?
- answer: Legalism
  context: 'East Asian cultures are influenced by two schools of thought, Confucianism,
    which advocated good governance as rule by leaders who are benevolent and virtuous,
    and Legalism, which advocated strict adherence to law. The influence of one school
    of thought over the other has varied throughout the centuries. One study indicates
    that throughout East Asia, only South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Hong
    Kong have societies that are robustly committed to a law-bound state. According
    to Awzar Thi, a member of the Asian Human Rights Commission, the rule of law in
    Thailand, Cambodia, and most of Asia is weak or nonexistent:'
  question: What East Asian philosophy emphasized unwavering rule following?
- answer: Benjamin Disraeli
  context: Palmerston died in 1865, and after a brief ministry led by Russell, Derby
    returned to power. In 1866, Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament
    for the first time since Albert's death. The following year she supported the
    passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise
    to many urban working men, though she was not in favour of votes for women. Derby
    resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria. "Everyone
    likes flattery," he said, "and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with
    a trowel." With the phrase "we authors, Ma'am", he complimented her. Disraeli's
    ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal
    rival, William Ewart Gladstone, was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone's
    demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained,
    as though she were "a public meeting rather than a woman".
  question: Who replaced Derby when he resigned in 1868?
- answer: 69%
  context: Advanced economies led global economic growth prior to the financial crisis
    with "emerging" and "developing" economies lagging behind. The crisis completely
    overturned this relationship. The International Monetary Fund found that "advanced"
    economies accounted for only 31% of global GDP while emerging and developing economies
    accounted for 69% of global GDP from 2007 to 2014. In the tables, the names of
    emergent economies are shown in boldface type, while the names of developed economies
    are in Roman (regular) type.
  question: How much global GDP did emerging and developing economies account for
    from 2007 to 2014?
- answer: two
  context: College sports are also popular in North Carolina, with 18 schools competing
    at the Division I level. The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is headquartered
    in Greensboro, and both the ACC Football Championship Game (Charlotte) and the
    ACC Men's Basketball Tournament (Greensboro) were most recently held in North
    Carolina. College basketball in particular is very popular, buoyed by the Tobacco
    Road rivalries between Duke, North Carolina, North Carolina State, and Wake Forest.
    The ACC Championship Game and The Belk Bowl are held annually in Charlotte's Bank
    of America Stadium, featuring teams from the ACC and the Southeastern Conference.
    Additionally, the state has hosted the NCAA Men's Basketball Final Four on two
    occasions, in Greensboro in 1974 and in Charlotte in 1994.
  question: How many times has North Carolina hosted the NCAA final four?
- answer: one of the smallest genomes
  context: A considerable amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from
    studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis
    thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or
    hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about
    135 million base pairs of DNA, forming one of the smallest genomes among flowering
    plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000.
    The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa)
    and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding
    the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots
    generally.
  question: Why was this plant chosen for sequencing?
- answer: two
  context: PAL LaserDiscs have a slightly longer playing time than NTSC discs, but
    have fewer audio options. PAL discs only have two audio tracks, consisting of
    either two analog-only tracks on older PAL LDs, or two digital-only tracks on
    newer discs. In comparison, later NTSC LDs are capable of carrying four tracks
    (two analog and two digital). On certain releases, one of the analog tracks is
    used to carry a modulated AC-3 signal for 5.1 channel audio (for decoding and
    playback by newer LD players with an "AC-3 RF" output). However, older NTSC LDs
    made before 1984 (such as the original DiscoVision discs) only have two analog
    audio tracks.
  question: How many audio tracks do PAL LaserDiscs have?
- answer: examples include Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur.
  context: "Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running\
    \ of the team, including the training, team selection, and player acquisition.\
    \ Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of\
    \ the club and the relationship of the manager with fans. Managers are required\
    \ to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available,\
    \ and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences. The UEFA Pro Licence\
    \ is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League\
    \ on a permanent basis (i.e. more than 12 weeks \u2013 the amount of time an unqualified\
    \ caretaker manager is allowed to take control). Caretaker appointments are managers\
    \ that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several\
    \ caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after\
    \ performing well as a caretaker; examples include Paul Hart at Portsmouth and\
    \ David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur."
  question: Give an example of someone who was a caretaker manager?
- answer: Internet Explorer
  context: Internet Explorer, on the other hand, was bundled free with the Windows
    operating system (and was also downloadable free), and therefore it was funded
    partly by the sales of Windows to computer manufacturers and direct to users.
    Internet Explorer also used to be available for the Mac. It is likely that releasing
    IE for the Mac was part of Microsoft's overall strategy to fight threats to its
    quasi-monopoly platform dominance - threats such as web standards and Java - by
    making some web developers, or at least their managers, assume that there was

  question: What was bundled for free with the Windows OS?
- answer: Marion Square
  context: Charleston's oldest community theater group, the Footlight Players, has
    provided theatrical productions since 1931. A variety of performing arts venues
    includes the historic Dock Street Theatre. The annual Charleston Fashion Week
    held each spring in Marion Square brings in designers, journalists, and clients
    from across the nation. Charleston is known for its local seafood, which plays
    a key role in the city's renowned cuisine, comprising staple dishes such as gumbo,
    she-crab soup, fried oysters, Lowcountry boil, deviled crab cakes, red rice, and
    shrimp and grits. Rice is the staple in many dishes, reflecting the rice culture
    of the Low Country. The cuisine in Charleston is also strongly influenced by British
    and French elements.
  question: Where is the  annual Charleston Fashion week held?
- answer: Phoenix
  context: Interstate 10, which runs southeast to northwest through town, connects
    Tucson to Phoenix to the northwest on the way to its western terminus in Santa
    Monica, California, and to Las Cruces, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas toward its
    eastern terminus in Jacksonville, Florida. I-19 runs south from Tucson toward
    Nogales and the U.S.-Mexico border. I-19 is the only Interstate highway that uses
    "kilometer posts" instead of "mileposts", although the speed limits are marked
    in miles per hour instead of kilometers per hour.
  question: What is the next major town to the west on I-10?
- answer: Austria and Prussia
  context: The Napoleonic Wars were the cause of the final dissolution of the Holy
    Roman Empire, and ultimately the cause for the quest for a German nation state
    in 19th-century German nationalism. After the Congress of Vienna, Austria and
    Prussia emerged as two competitors. Austria, trying to remain the dominant power
    in Central Europe, led the way in the terms of the Congress of Vienna. The Congress
    of Vienna was essentially conservative, assuring that little would change in Europe
    and preventing Germany from uniting. These terms came to a sudden halt following
    the Revolutions of 1848 and the Crimean War in 1856, paving the way for German
    unification in the 1860s. By the 1820s, large numbers of Jewish German women had
    intermarried with Christian German men and had converted to Christianity. Jewish
    German Eduard Lasker was a prominent German nationalist figure who promoted the
    unification of Germany in the mid-19th century.
  question: What two countries emerged as competitors after the Congress of Vienna?
- answer: a fisherman who moved buoys
  context: "In July 1855, the allied squadron tried to go past Taganrog to Rostov\
    \ on Don, entering the Don River through the Mius River. On 12 July 1855 HMS Jasper\
    \ grounded near Taganrog thanks to a fisherman who moved buoys into shallow water.\
    \ The Cossacks captured the gunboat with all of its guns and blew it up. The third\
    \ siege attempt was made 19\u201331 August 1855, but the city was already fortified\
    \ and the squadron could not approach close enough for landing operations. The\
    \ allied fleet left the Gulf of Taganrog on the 2nd September 1855, with minor\
    \ military operations along the Azov Sea coast continuing until late autumn 1855."
  question: What caused the HMS Jasper to get stuck in shallow water?
- answer: Church of Scotland
  context: 'Since Elizabeth rarely gives interviews, little is known of her personal
    feelings. As a constitutional monarch, she has not expressed her own political
    opinions in a public forum. She does have a deep sense of religious and civic
    duty, and takes her coronation oath seriously. Aside from her official religious
    role as Supreme Governor of the established Church of England, she is personally
    a member of that church and the national Church of Scotland. She has demonstrated
    support for inter-faith relations and has met with leaders of other churches and
    religions, including five popes: Pius XII, John XXIII, John Paul II, Benedict
    XVI and Francis. A personal note about her faith often features in her annual
    Christmas message broadcast to the Commonwealth. In 2000, she spoke about the
    theological significance of the millennium marking the 2000th anniversary of the
    birth of Jesus:'
  question: Apart from her membership in the Church of England, to what other church
    does she belong?
- answer: '- the cup itself, plus a lid and a base'
  context: The trophy comes in three parts - the cup itself, plus a lid and a base.
    There have been two designs of trophy in use, but five physical trophies have
    been presented. The original trophy, known as the "little tin idol", was 18 inches
    high and made by Martin, Hall & Co. It was stolen in 1895 and never recovered,
    and so was replaced by an exact replica, used until 1910. The FA decided to change
    the design after the 1909 winners, Manchester United, made their own replica,
    leading the FA to realise they did not own the copyright. This new, larger design
    was by Messers Fattorini and Sons, and was used from 1911. In order to preserve
    this original, from 1992 it was replaced by an exact replica, although this had
    to be replaced after just over two decades, after showing wear and tear from being
    handled more than in previous eras. This third replica, first used in 2014, was
    built heavier to withstand the increased handling. Of the four surviving trophies,
    only the 1895 replica has entered private ownership.
  question: What is the  parts of the trophy?
- answer: for collaboration potentially between wireless and life sciences
  context: San Diego hosts several major producers of wireless cellular technology.
    Qualcomm was founded and is headquartered in San Diego, and is one of the largest
    private-sector employers in San Diego. Other wireless industry manufacturers headquartered
    here include Nokia, LG Electronics, Kyocera International., Cricket Communications
    and Novatel Wireless. The largest software company in San Diego is security software
    company Websense Inc. San Diego also has the U.S. headquarters for the Slovakian
    security company ESET. San Diego has been designated as an iHub Innovation Center
    for collaboration potentially between wireless and life sciences.
  question: Why is San Diego known as an iHub Innovation Center?
- answer: Temple University
  context: 'The city''s largest private school by number of students is Temple University,
    followed by Drexel University. Along with the University of Pennsylvania, Temple
    University and Drexel University make up the city''s major research universities.
    The city is also home to five schools of medicine: Drexel University College of
    Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia
    College of Osteopathic Medicine, Temple University School of Medicine, and the
    Thomas Jefferson University. Hospitals, universities, and higher education research
    institutions in Philadelphia''s four congressional districts received more than
    $252 million in National Institutes of Health grants in 2015.'
  question: What is the largest private institution in the city?
- answer: those left homeless
  context: The Red Cross Society of China flew 557 tents and 2,500 quilts valued at
    788,000 yuan (US$113,000) to Wenchuan County. The Amity Foundation already began
    relief work in the region and has earmarked US$143,000 for disaster relief. The
    Sichuan Ministry of Civil Affairs said that they have provided 30,000 tents for
    those left homeless.
  question: What were all these tents and quilts for?
- answer: Veronal
  context: In 1903 Hermann Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering disclosed their discovery
    that diethylbarbituric acid, formed from the reaction of diethylmalonic acid,
    phosphorus oxychloride and urea, induces sleep in dogs. The discovery was patented
    and licensed to Bayer pharmaceuticals, which marketed the compound under the trade
    name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the
    effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action led to the discovery
    of phenobarbital at Bayer in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic
    activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment
    of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organizations
    list of essential medications. The 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of
    the addictive properties and abuse potential of barbiturates and amphetamines
    and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight
    of prescribers. Today, amphetamine is largely restricted to use in the treatment
    of attention deficit disorder and phenobarbital in the treatment of epilepsy.
  question: What sleep aid was marketed in 1904?
- answer: geographers
  context: Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists
    typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions.
    Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material,
    such as the Paleolithic and the Neolithic, of particular use in archaeology.[citation
    needed] Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as Olduwan
    or Mousterian or Levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in
    understanding major trends in the human past.[citation needed] Anthropologists
    and geographers share approaches to Culture regions as well, since mapping cultures
    is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions
    (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed
    various kinds of comparative method, a central part of their science.
  question: Mapping cultures is central to both the sciences of anthropologists and
    who else?
- answer: as many as 10,000
  context: The League of American Bicyclists gave Tucson a gold rating for bicycle
    friendliness in late April 2007. Tucson hosts the largest perimeter cycling event
    in the United States. The ride called "El Tour de Tucson" happens in November
    on the Saturday before Thanksgiving. El Tour de Tucson produced and promoted by
    Perimeter Bicycling has as many as 10,000 participants from all over the world,
    annually. Tucson is one of only nine cities in the U.S. to receive a gold rating
    or higher for cycling friendliness from the League of American Bicyclists. The
    city is known for its winter cycling opportunities. Both road and mountain biking
    are popular in and around Tucson with trail areas including Starr Pass and Fantasy
    Island.
  question: How many people participate in El Tour de Tucson?
- answer: Spori
  context: 'Procopius wrote in 545 that "the Sclaveni and the Antae actually had a
    single name in the remote past; for they were both called Spori in olden times."
    He describes their social structure and beliefs:'
  question: Procopius said Sclaveni and Antae were both called what?
- answer: ARCUK
  context: Soon after the passing of the 1931 Act, in the book published on the occasion
    of the Institute's centenary celebration in 1934, Harry Barnes, FRIBA, Chairman
    of the Registration Committee, mentioned that ARCUK could not be a rival of any
    architectural association, least of all the RIBA, given the way ARCUK was constituted.
    Barnes commented that the Act's purpose was not protecting the architectural profession,
    and that the legitimate interests of the profession were best served by the (then)
    architectural associations in which some 80 per cent of those practising architecture
    were to be found.
  question: What specific institution did Barnes indicate could not be a rival of
    the Royal Institute?
- answer: nondirectional
  context: The radiation pattern of an antenna is a plot of the relative field strength
    of the radio waves emitted by the antenna at different angles. It is typically
    represented by a three-dimensional graph, or polar plots of the horizontal and
    vertical cross sections. The pattern of an ideal isotropic antenna, which radiates
    equally in all directions, would look like a sphere. Many nondirectional antennas,
    such as monopoles and dipoles, emit equal power in all horizontal directions,
    with the power dropping off at higher and lower angles; this is called an omnidirectional
    pattern and when plotted looks like a torus or donut.
  question: Dipoles are considered to be what antenna type?
- answer: six
  context: Chopin's qualities as a pianist and composer were recognized by many of
    his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite Carnaval, and
    Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F major to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's
    music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works. Liszt later transcribed for
    piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan,
    with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by
    Chopin's death.
  question: How many of Chopin's Polish songs did Liszt transliterate for piano?
- answer: Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons; others during weekday
    evenings
  context: The Premier League is a corporation in which the 20 member clubs act as
    shareholders. Seasons run from August to May. Teams play 38 matches each (playing
    each team in the league twice, home and away), totalling 380 matches in the season.
    Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons; others during weekday
    evenings. It is currently sponsored by Barclays Bank and thus officially known
    as the Barclays Premier League and is colloquially known as the Premiership. Outside
    the UK it is commonly referred to as the English Premier League (EPL).
  question: What days are most games played?
- answer: Germany
  context: "In Germany, groups such as Einst\xFCrzende Neubauten developed a unique\
    \ style of industrial music, utilizing avant-garde noise, homemade instruments\
    \ and found objects. Members of that group would later go on to collaborate with\
    \ members of the Birthday Party. In Brazil, the post-punk scene grew after the\
    \ generation of Brasilia rock with bands such as Legi\xE3o Urbana, Capital Inicial\
    \ and Plebe Rude and then the opening of the music club Madame Sat\xE3 in S\xE3\
    o Paulo, with acts like Cabine C, Tit\xE3s, Patife Band, Fellini and Mercen\xE1\
    rias, as documented on compilations like The Sexual Life of the Savages and the\
    \ N\xE3o Wave/N\xE3o S\xE3o Paulo series, released in the UK, Germany and Brazil,\
    \ respectively.[citation needed]"
  question: "Where was Einst\xFCrzende Neubauten from?"
- answer: regulator and company employees
  context: "Ben Goldacre has argued that regulators \u2013 such as the Medicines and\
    \ Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK, or the Food and Drug\
    \ Administration (FDA) in the United States \u2013 advance the interests of the\
    \ drug companies rather than the interests of the public due to revolving door\
    \ exchange of employees between the regulator and the companies and friendships\
    \ develop between regulator and company employees. He argues that regulators do\
    \ not require that new drugs offer an improvement over what is already available,\
    \ or even that they be particularly effective."
  question: The business friendships between which parties have been criticized?
- answer: Elliott Coues
  context: "Aristotle however suggested that swallows and other birds hibernated.\
    \ This belief persisted as late as 1878, when Elliott Coues listed the titles\
    \ of no less than 182 papers dealing with the hibernation of swallows. Even the\
    \ \"highly observant\" Gilbert White, in his posthumously published 1789 The Natural\
    \ History of Selborne, quoted a man's story about swallows being found in a chalk\
    \ cliff collapse \"while he was a schoolboy at Brighthelmstone\", though the man\
    \ denied being an eyewitness. However, he also writes that \"as to swallows being\
    \ found in a torpid state during the winter in the Isle of Wight or any part of\
    \ this country, I never heard any such account worth attending to\", and that\
    \ if early swallows \"happen to find frost and snow they immediately withdraw\
    \ for a time\u2014a circumstance this much more in favour of hiding than migration\"\
    , since he doubts they would \"return for a week or two to warmer latitudes\"."
  question: Who wrote 182 papers dealing with the hibernation of swallows?
- answer: aerobic exercises
  context: Physical exercise, particularly continuous aerobic exercises such as running,
    cycling and swimming, has many cognitive benefits and effects on the brain. Influences
    on the brain include increases in neurotransmitter levels, improved oxygen and
    nutrient delivery, and increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus. The effects
    of exercise on memory have important implications for improving children's academic
    performance, maintaining mental abilities in old age, and the prevention and potential
    cure of neurological diseases.
  question: What type of excercise has shown the best benefit for the brain?
- answer: demobilized
  context: The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war that occurred within the former
    Russian Empire after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the Soviets
    under the domination of the Bolshevik party assumed power, first in Petrograd
    (St. Petersburg) and then in other places. In the wake of the October Revolution,
    the old Russian Imperial Army had been demobilized; the volunteer-based Red Guard
    was the Bolsheviks' main military force, augmented by an armed military component
    of the Cheka, the Bolshevik state security apparatus. There was an instituted
    mandatory conscription of the rural peasantry into the Red Army. Opposition of
    rural Russians to Red Army conscription units was overcome by taking hostages
    and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance. Former Tsarist
    officers were utilized as "military specialists" (voenspetsy), taking their families
    hostage in order to ensure loyalty. At the start of the war, three-fourths of
    the Red Army officer corps was composed of former Tsarist officers. By its end,
    83% of all Red Army divisional and corps commanders were ex-Tsarist soldiers.
  question: In the wake of the October resolution, what happened to the Russian Imperial
    Army?
- answer: altruism
  context: "Eliot and her circle, who included her companion George Henry Lewes (the\
    \ biographer of Goethe) and the abolitionist and social theorist Harriet Martineau,\
    \ were much influenced by the positivism of Auguste Comte, whom Martineau had\
    \ translated. Comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles\
    \ \u2013 a secular Religion of Humanity (which worshiped the dead, since most\
    \ humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled\
    \ on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism.\
    \ Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part\
    \ rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion\
    \ of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to \"vivre\
    \ pour altrui\" (\"live for others\", from which comes the word \"altruism\"),\
    \ and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets\
    \ from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy."
  question: What currently used word was based in ideas from this philosopher?
- answer: big-game hunters
  context: During the feudal and colonial times in British India, hunting was regarded
    as a regal sport in the numerous princely states, as many maharajas and nawabs,
    as well as British officers, maintained a whole corps of shikaris (big-game hunters),
    who were native professional hunters. They would be headed by a master of the
    hunt, who might be styled mir-shikar. Often, they recruited the normally low-ranking
    local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting
    techniques. Big game, such as Bengal tigers, might be hunted from the back of
    an elephant.
  question: What does the Indian word "shikaris" mean in English?
- answer: plastic waste
  context: The rising population has resulted in an increased demand on fish stocks,
    which are under stress; although the creation of the Funafuti Conservation Area
    has provided a fishing exclusion area to help sustain the fish population across
    the Funafuti lagoon. Population pressure on the resources of Funafuti and inadequate
    sanitation systems have resulted in pollution. The Waste Operations and Services
    Act of 2009 provides the legal framework for waste management and pollution control
    projects funded by the European Union directed at organic waste composting in
    eco-sanitation systems. The Environment Protection (Litter and Waste Control)
    Regulation 2013 is intended to improve the management of the importation of non-biodegradable
    materials. In Tuvalu plastic waste is a problem as much imported food and other
    commodities are supplied in plastic containers or packaging.
  question: What do imports produce on Tuvalu?
- answer: Short-toed eagles (Circaetus gallicus), tawny eagles (Aquila rapax), spotted
    eagles (Aquila clanga)
  context: The Desert National Park in Jaisalmer is spread over an area of 3,162 square
    kilometres (1,221 sq mi), is an excellent example of the ecosystem of the Thar
    Desert and its diverse fauna. Seashells and massive fossilised tree trunks in
    this park record the geological history of the desert. The region is a haven for
    migratory and resident birds of the desert. One can see many eagles, harriers,
    falcons, buzzards, kestrels and vultures. Short-toed eagles (Circaetus gallicus),
    tawny eagles (Aquila rapax), spotted eagles (Aquila clanga), laggar falcons (Falco
    jugger) and kestrels are the commonest of these.
  question: What are the most common types of eagles one might see in the Jaisalmer
    region?
- answer: None of these lines, in Somerset, are electrified.
  context: 'The usefulness of the canals was short-lived, though some have now been
    restored for recreation. The 19th century also saw the construction of railways
    to and through Somerset. The county was served by five pre-1923 Grouping railway
    companies: the Great Western Railway (GWR); a branch of the Midland Railway (MR)
    to Bath Green Park (and another one to Bristol); the Somerset and Dorset Joint
    Railway, and the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR). The former main lines
    of the GWR are still in use today, although many of its branch lines were scrapped
    under the notorious Beeching Axe. The former lines of the Somerset and Dorset
    Joint Railway closed completely, as has the branch of the Midland Railway to Bath
    Green Park (and to Bristol St Philips); however, the L&SWR survived as a part
    of the present West of England Main Line. None of these lines, in Somerset, are
    electrified. Two branch lines, the West and East Somerset Railways, were rescued
    and transferred back to private ownership as "heritage" lines. The fifth railway
    was a short-lived light railway, the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway.
    The West Somerset Mineral Railway carried the iron ore from the Brendon Hills
    to Watchet.'
  question: Were any of the railways  electrified
- answer: Lossless data compression algorithms
  context: Lossless data compression algorithms usually exploit statistical redundancy
    to represent data without losing any information, so that the process is reversible.
    Lossless compression is possible because most real-world data exhibits statistical
    redundancy. For example, an image may have areas of colour that do not change
    over several pixels; instead of coding "red pixel, red pixel, ..." the data may
    be encoded as "279 red pixels". This is a basic example of run-length encoding;
    there are many schemes to reduce file size by eliminating redundancy.
  question: What usually exploits statistical redundancy?
- answer: Sekundarschule
  context: 'Starting in 2010/2011, Hauptschulen were merged with Realschulen and Gesamtschulen
    to form a new type of comprehensive school in the German States of Berlin and
    Hamburg, called Stadtteilschule in Hamburg and Sekundarschule in Berlin (see:
    Education in Berlin, Education in Hamburg).'
  question: What was the combination of Hauptschulen with Realschulen and Gesamtschulen
    called in Berlin?
- answer: sensual
  context: During the celebration, theaters called tablados are built in many places
    throughout the cities, especially in Montevideo. Traditionally formed by men and
    now starting to be open to women, the different Carnival groups (Murgas, Lubolos
    or Parodistas) perform a kind of popular opera at the tablados, singing and dancing
    songs that generally relate to the social and political situation. The 'Calls'
    groups, basically formed by drummers playing the tamboril, perform candombe rhythmic
    figures. Revelers wear their festival clothing. Each group has its own theme.
    Women wearing elegant, bright dresses are called vedettes and provide a sensual
    touch to parades.
  question: What sort of touch do the vedettes provide to the parades?
- answer: Tibetans and Qiang
  context: "Garz\xEA Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous\
    \ Prefecture in western Sichuan are populated by Tibetans and Qiang people. Tibetans\
    \ speak the Khams and Amdo Tibetan, which are Tibetic languages, as well as various\
    \ Qiangic languages. The Qiang speak Qiangic languages and often Tibetic languages\
    \ as well. The Yi people of Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in southern Sichuan\
    \ speak the Nuosu language, which is one of the Lolo-Burmese languages; Yi is\
    \ written using the Yi script, a syllabary standardized in 1974. The Southwest\
    \ University for Nationalities has one of China's most prominent Tibetology departments,\
    \ and the Southwest Minorities Publishing House prints literature in minority\
    \ languages. In the minority inhabited regions of Sichuan, there is bi-lingual\
    \ signage and public school instruction in non-Mandarin minority languages."
  question: What are the largest minorities of western Sichuan?
- answer: apex
  context: "The head is enclosed in a hard, heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal\
    \ head capsule, or epicranium, which contains most of the sensing organs, including\
    \ the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts. Of all the insect orders,\
    \ Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the\
    \ sutures and sclerites. Here, the vertex, or the apex (dorsal region), is situated\
    \ between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous\
    \ head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes,\
    \ but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary axis\
    \ of the head is rotated 90\xB0 to become parallel to the primary axis of the\
    \ body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.:13"
  question: What is the vertex also known as?
- answer: Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis
  context: Evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for paleopathologists,
    scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms.
    Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs.
    When present, however, these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small
    regions of the body. A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur Herrerasaurus
    ischigualastensis exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone.
    The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted
    by a short-lived, non-lethal infection. Scientists who studied the skull speculated
    that the bite marks were received in a fight with another Herrerasaurus. Other
    carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include Acrocanthosaurus,
    Allosaurus, Tyrannosaurus and a tyrannosaur from the Kirtland Formation. The infections
    from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight, like the
    Herrerasaurus specimen.
  question: What dinosaur's skull had pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous
    bone?
- answer: enter a special physiological state termed competence
  context: Transformation, unlike transduction or conjugation, depends on numerous
    bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process,
    and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer. In
    order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome,
    it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see Natural
    competence). In Bacillus subtilis, about 40 genes are required for the development
    of competence. The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation
    can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome. Transformation
    appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species
    are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation.
    The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental
    conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage
    in recipient cells.
  question: What is the first requirement in order for bacteria to bind and recombine
    with other bacteria's DNA
- answer: international movement
  context: High neoclassicism was an international movement. Though neoclassical architecture
    employed the same classical vocabulary as Late Baroque architecture, it tended
    to emphasize its planar qualities, rather than sculptural volumes. Projections
    and recessions and their effects of light and shade were more flat; sculptural
    bas-reliefs were flatter and tended to be enframed in friezes, tablets or panels.
    Its clearly articulated individual features were isolated rather than interpenetrating,
    autonomous and complete in themselves.
  question: How broad was the reach of high neoclassicism?
- answer: Georgia
  context: 'Other capital crimes include: the use of a weapon of mass destruction
    resulting in death, espionage, terrorism, certain violations of the Geneva Conventions

  question: How many representatives does the Premier League have for the European
    Club Association for 2012-13?
- answer: Mary McDonough Murphy
  context: Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication. Literary analysis
    of it is sparse, considering the number of copies sold and its widespread use
    in education. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual impressions
    of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures, calls the book,
    "an astonishing phenomenon". In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead
    of the Bible as one "every adult should read before they die". It was adapted
    into an Oscar-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay
    by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually
    in Harper Lee's hometown of Monroeville, Alabama.
  question: Who gathered impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird from other authors and
    famous people?
- answer: arrows or shaped like arrows
  context: Direction lanterns are also found both inside and outside elevator cars,
    but they should always be visible from outside because their primary purpose is
    to help people decide whether or not to get on the elevator. If somebody waiting
    for the elevator wants to go up, but a car comes first that indicates that it
    is going down, then the person may decide not to get on the elevator. If the person
    waits, then one will still stop going up. Direction indicators are sometimes etched
    with arrows or shaped like arrows and/or use the convention that one that lights
    up red means "down" and green means "up". Since the color convention is often
    undermined or overridden by systems that do not invoke it, it is usually used
    only in conjunction with other differentiating factors. An example of a place
    whose elevators use only the color convention to differentiate between directions
    is the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, where a single circle can be made
    to light up green for "up" and red for "down". Sometimes directions must be inferred
    by the position of the indicators relative to one another.
  question: What type of etching might you see on a direction indicator?
- answer: '1995'
  context: Since the mid-1980s, Spielberg has increased his role as a film producer.
    He headed up the production team for several cartoons, including the Warner Bros.
    hits Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, Toonsylvania, and
    Freakazoid!, for which he collaborated with Jean MacCurdy and Tom Ruegger. Due
    to his work on these series, in the official titles, most of them say, "Steven
    Spielberg presents" as well as making numerous cameos on the shows. Spielberg
    also produced the Don Bluth animated features, An American Tail and The Land Before
    Time, which were released by Universal Studios. He also served as one of the executive
    producers of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and its three related shorts (Tummy Trouble,
    Roller Coaster Rabbit, Trail Mix-Up), which were all released by Disney, under
    both the Walt Disney Pictures and the Touchstone Pictures banners. He was furthermore,
    for a short time, the executive producer of the long-running medical drama ER.
    In 1989, he brought the concept of The Dig to LucasArts. He contributed to the
    project from that time until 1995 when the game was released. He also collaborated
    with software publishers Knowledge Adventure on the multimedia game Steven Spielberg's
    Director's Chair, which was released in 1996. Spielberg appears, as himself, in
    the game to direct the player. The Spielberg name provided branding for a Lego
    Moviemaker kit, the proceeds of which went to the Starbright Foundation.
  question: When was 'The Dig' released?
- answer: 70 to 74
  context: "Fused quartz is a glass made from chemically-pure SiO2 (silica). It has\
    \ excellent thermal shock characteristics, being able to survive immersion in\
    \ water while red hot. However, its high melting-temperature (1723 \xB0C) and\
    \ viscosity make it difficult to work with. Normally, other substances are added\
    \ to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, \"soda\"), which lowers\
    \ the glass transition temperature. The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which\
    \ is usually undesirable, so lime (calcium oxide [CaO], generally obtained from\
    \ limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added\
    \ to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about\
    \ 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass. Soda-lime glasses\
    \ account for about 90% of manufactured glass."
  question: What percentage of soda-lime glass is silica?
- answer: construction errors
  context: Unit testing is a software development process that involves synchronized
    application of a broad spectrum of defect prevention and detection strategies
    in order to reduce software development risks, time, and costs. It is performed
    by the software developer or engineer during the construction phase of the software
    development lifecycle. Rather than replace traditional QA focuses, it augments
    it. Unit testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted
    to QA; this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software
    as well as the efficiency of the overall development and QA process.
  question: What does Unit testing look to eliminate?
- answer: R&B
  context: "Beyonc\xE9's music is generally R&B, but she also incorporates pop, soul\
    \ and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyonc\xE9's exploration of 90s-style\
    \ R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases.\
    \ While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyonc\xE9 recorded several\
    \ Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language\
    \ audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyonc\xE9 was coached\
    \ phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez."
  question: "What style of music does Beyonc\xE9 usually perform?"
- answer: Conroy
  context: Though queen, as an unmarried young woman Victoria was required by social
    convention to live with her mother, despite their differences over the Kensington
    System and her mother's continued reliance on Conroy. Her mother was consigned
    to a remote apartment in Buckingham Palace, and Victoria often refused to see
    her. When Victoria complained to Melbourne that her mother's close proximity promised
    "torment for many years", Melbourne sympathised but said it could be avoided by
    marriage, which Victoria called a "schocking  [sic] alternative". She showed interest
    in Albert's education for the future role he would have to play as her husband,
    but she resisted attempts to rush her into wedlock.
  question: Victoria and her mother had differences over her mothers reliances on
    who?
- answer: conservationists and sportsmen
  context: Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century.
    Some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode
    of Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club. Local hunting clubs and
    national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of
    the sport by buying land for future hunting use. Some groups represent a specific
    hunting interest, such as Ducks Unlimited, Pheasants Forever, or the Delta Waterfowl
    Foundation. Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government
    and state government.
  question: What do modern hunters see themselves as?
- answer: South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative
  context: To encourage further discovery, researchers and policymakers are promoting
    new economic models of vaccine development, including prizes, tax incentives,
    and advance market commitments. A number of groups, including the Stop TB Partnership,
    the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, and the Aeras Global TB Vaccine
    Foundation, are involved with research. Among these, the Aeras Global TB Vaccine
    Foundation received a gift of more than $280 million (US) from the Bill and Melinda
    Gates Foundation to develop and license an improved vaccine against tuberculosis
    for use in high burden countries.
  question: What group with the initials SATVI is researching TB vaccines?
- answer: 1.5 million
  context: The wider New York City metropolitan area, with over 20 million people,
    about 50% greater than the second-place Los Angeles metropolitan area in the United
    States, is also ethnically diverse. The New York region continues to be by far
    the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United
    States, substantially exceeding the combined totals of Los Angeles and Miami,
    the next most popular gateway regions. It is home to the largest Jewish as well
    as Israeli communities outside Israel, with the Jewish population in the region
    numbering over 1.5 million in 2012 and including many diverse Jewish sects from
    around the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The metropolitan area is also home
    to 20% of the nation's Indian Americans and at least 20 Little India enclaves,
    as well as 15% of all Korean Americans and four Koreatowns; the largest Asian
    Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest Russian American, Italian
    American, and African American populations; the largest Dominican American, Puerto
    Rican American, and South American and second-largest overall Hispanic population
    in the United States, numbering 4.8 million; and includes at least 6 established
    Chinatowns within New York City alone, with the urban agglomeration comprising
    a population of 779,269 overseas Chinese as of 2013 Census estimates, the largest
    outside of Asia.
  question: As of 2012, how many Jewish people lived in the New York metropolitan
    area?

  question: What percent of Parisians work in hotels and restaurants?
- answer: Bahamas
  context: Black labor played a crucial role in Miami's early development. During
    the beginning of the 20th century, migrants from the Bahamas and African-Americans
    constituted 40 percent of the city's population. Whatever their role in the city's
    growth, their community's growth was limited to a small space. When landlords
    began to rent homes to African-Americans in neighborhoods close to Avenue J (what
    would later become NW Fifth Avenue), a gang of white man with torches visited
    the renting families and warned them to move or be bombed.
  question: Where did a portion of Miami's black population migrate from in the early
    1900s?
- answer: Akkadian
  context: "Native Sumerian rule re-emerged for about a century in the Neo-Sumerian\
    \ Empire or Third Dynasty of Ur (Sumerian Renaissance) approximately 2100-2000\
    \ BC, but the Akkadian language also remained in use. The Sumerian city of Eridu,\

    \ city, where three separate cultures may have fused \u2014 that of peasant Ubaidian\
    \ farmers, living in mud-brick huts and practicing irrigation; that of mobile\
    \ nomadic Semitic pastoralists living in black tents and following herds of sheep\
    \ and goats; and that of fisher folk, living in reed huts in the marshlands, who\
    \ may have been the ancestors of the Sumerians."
  question: What language was in use in the Neo-Sumerian Empire?
- answer: scatter more strongly
  context: As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to the eye, some
    of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles
    due to Rayleigh scattering, changing the final color of the beam that is seen.
    Colors with a shorter wavelength, such as blue and green, scatter more strongly,
    and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye. At sunrise and sunset,
    when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest, the
    blue and green components are removed almost completely, leaving the longer wavelength
    orange and red light. The remaining reddened sunlight can also be scattered by
    cloud droplets and other relatively large particles, which give the sky above
    the horizon its red glow.
  question: What occurs to colors of short wavelengths in Rayleigh scattering?
- answer: file systems
  context: Although browsers are primarily intended to use the World Wide Web, they
    can also be used to access information provided by web servers in private networks
    or files in file systems.
  question: A browser can also access files where?
- answer: "\u015Arauta sacrifices"
  context: "From the fifth century to the thirteenth, \u015Arauta sacrifices declined,\
    \ and initiatory traditions of Buddhism, Jainism or more commonly Shaivism, Vaishnavism\
    \ and Shaktism expanded in royal courts. This period produced some of India's\
    \ finest art, considered the epitome of classical development, and the development\
    \ of the main spiritual and philosophical systems which continued to be in Hinduism,\
    \ Buddhism and Jainism. Emperor Harsha of Kannauj succeeded in reuniting northern\
    \ India during his reign in the 7th century, after the collapse of the Gupta dynasty.\
    \ His empire collapsed after his death."
  question: What declined from the 5th to the 13th centuries
- answer: Defence Infrastructure Organisation
  context: The defence estate is divided as training areas & ranges (84.0%), research
    & development (5.4%), airfields (3.4%), barracks & camps (2.5%), storage & supply
    depots (1.6%), and other (3.0%). These are largely managed by the Defence Infrastructure
    Organisation.
  question: Who manages the defence estate?
- answer: Mejit
  context: "The Spanish ship San Pedro and two other vessels in an expedition commanded\
    \ by Miguel L\xF3pez de Legazpi discovered an island on January 9, 1530, possibly\
    \ Mejit, at 10\xB0N, which they named \"Los Barbudos\". The Spaniards went ashore\
    \ and traded with the local inhabitants. On January 10, the Spaniards sighted\
    \ another island that they named \"Placeres\", perhaps Ailuk; ten leagues away,\
    \ they sighted another island that they called \"Pajares\" (perhaps Jemo). On\

  question: What is thought to be the modern name of the island Legazpi called Los
    Barbudos?
- answer: the mistake of appeasement
  context: 'On Saturday, 24 June 1950, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed
    President Truman that the North Koreans had invaded South Korea. Truman and Acheson
    discussed a U.S. invasion response and agreed that the United States was obligated
    to act, paralleling the North Korean invasion with Adolf Hitler''s aggressions
    in the 1930s, with the conclusion being that the mistake of appeasement must not
    be repeated. Several U.S. industries were mobilized to supply materials, labor,
    capital, production facilities, and other services necessary to support the military
    objectives of the Korean War. However, President Truman later acknowledged that
    he believed fighting the invasion was essential to the American goal of the global
    containment of communism as outlined in the National Security Council Report 68
    (NSC-68) (declassified in 1975):'
  question: What did the US not want to see repeated?
- answer: Black Boots
  context: Idris' government was increasingly unpopular by the latter 1960s; it had
    exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising
    the country's federal system in order to take advantage of the country's oil wealth,
    while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout
    the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared
    up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the
    western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-western riots
    broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals
    in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting
    segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made
    that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance,
    stating that they were monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary
    group.
  question: What revolutionary organization was led by Abdul Aziz Shalhi?
- answer: Ann Arbor Film Festival
  context: "Several annual events\u2014many of them centered on performing and visual\
    \ arts\u2014draw visitors to Ann Arbor. One such event is the Ann Arbor Art Fairs,\
    \ a set of four concurrent juried fairs held on downtown streets. Scheduled on\
    \ Wednesday through Saturday of the third week of July, the fairs draw upward\
    \ of half a million visitors. Another is the Ann Arbor Film Festival, held during\
    \ the third week of March, which receives more than 2,500 submissions annually\
    \ from more than 40 countries and serves as one of a handful of Academy Award\u2013\
    qualifying festivals in the United States."
  question: What is the name of the film festival held at Ann Arbor?
- answer: clitellates
  context: Most mature clitellates (the group that includes earthworms and leeches)
    are full hermaphrodites, although in a few leech species younger adults function
    as males and become female at maturity. All have well-developed gonads, and all
    copulate. Earthworms store their partners' sperm in spermathecae ("sperm stores")
    and then the clitellum produces a cocoon that collects ova from the ovaries and
    then sperm from the spermathecae. Fertilization and development of earthworm eggs
    takes place in the cocoon. Leeches' eggs are fertilized in the ovaries, and then
    transferred to the cocoon. In all clitellates the cocoon also either produces
    yolk when the eggs are fertilized or nutrients while they are developing. All
    clitellates hatch as miniature adults rather than larvae.
  question: What type of annelids hatch as miniature adults?
- answer: the Mega level
  context: The series is set three years after the events of Digimon Adventure 02,
    when Digimon who turn rogue by a mysterious infection appear to wreak havoc in
    the Human World. Tai and the other DigiDestined from the original series reunite
    with their partners and start fighting back with support from the Japanese government,
    while Davis, Yolei, Cody and Ken are defeated by a powerful enemy called Alphamon
    and disappear without a trace. Tai and the others also meet another DigiDestined
    called Meiko Mochizuki and her partner Meicoomon who become their friends, until
    Meicoomon turns hostile as well and flees after an encounter with Ken, who reappears
    suddenly, once again as the Digimon Emperor. The film series also feature several
    DigiDestined having their partners Digivolve up to the Mega level for the first
    time, a feat only Tai and Matt had achieved previously.
  question: What happened for the first time to the DigiDestined in the film series?
- answer: '2.45'
  context: In 2010, 24.9 percent of households reported having children under the
    age of 18 living with them, 28.3 percent were married couples living together
    and 22.5 percent had a female householder with no husband present, 6.0 percent
    had a male householder with no wife present, and 43.2 percent were non-families.
    The city reported 34.1 percent of all households were made up of individuals while
    10.5 percent had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average
    household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 3.20. In 2013, the percentage
    of women who gave birth in the previous 12 months who were unmarried was 56 percent.
    Of Philadelphia's adults, 31 percent were married or lived as a couple, 55 percent
    were not married, 11 percent were divorced or separated, and 3 percent were widowed.
  question: What is the size of the average household?
- answer: Jackie Chan.
  context: 'China: The torch returned to China for the first time since April. The
    torch arrived in Sanya, Hainan on May 4 with celebrations attended by International
    Olympic Committee (IOC) officials and Chinese big names like Jackie Chan. The
    entire relay through Mainland China was largely a success with many people welcoming
    the arrival of the torch along the way.'
  question: Which actor also attended the celebrations?
- answer: the practice of the beth din that converted him or her
  context: In this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is Sephardic, since most
    non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or
    not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or Mizrahi woman
    who marries into an Orthodox or Haredi Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children
    to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a Sephardi or
    Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit
    a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A convert generally
    follows the practice of the beth din that converted him or her. With the integration
    of Jews from around the world in Israel, North America, and other places, the
    religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside Orthodox
    Judaism.
  question: A convert generally follows which practice?
- answer: one
  context: "Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such\
    \ as the Revolutionary \xC9tude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64,\
    \ No. 1). However, with the exception of his Funeral March, the composer never\
    \ named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical\
    \ associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known\
    \ were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary\
    \ \xC9tude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind;\
    \ it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his\
    \ Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before\
    \ the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired\
    \ it."
  question: How many instrumental works did Chopin give a descriptive name to?
- answer: Wordless novels
  context: Some consider storyboards and wordless novels to be comics. Film studios,
    especially in animation, often use sequences of images as guides for film sequences.
    These storyboards are not intended as an end product and are rarely seen by the
    public. Wordless novels are books which use sequences of captionless images to
    deliver a narrative.
  question: A book with pictures with no captions that tell a story are called what?
- answer: '1740'
  context: While the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC,
    mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal is much
    softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of steel, (an alloy of iron and
    around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability
    to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since 1100 BC,
    and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because
    the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the
    production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction
    of blister steel during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating
    wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon
    was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, Benjamin Huntsman
    began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating
    the first process for the mass production of tool steel. Huntsman's process was
    used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.
  question: When did Benjamin Huntsman begin to melt blister steel in a crucible
- answer: three-quarters
  context: "The majority of the citizens of the Marshall Islands are of Marshallese\
    \ descent, though there are small numbers of immigrants from the United States,\
    \ China, Philippines and other Pacific islands. The two official languages are\
    \ Marshallese, which is a member of the Malayo-Polynesian languages, and English.\
    \ Almost the entire population of the islands practises some religion, with three-quarters\
    \ of the country either following the United Church of Christ \u2013 Congregational\
    \ in the Marshall Islands (UCCCMI) or the Assemblies of God."
  question: What fraction of Marshall Islands residents are religious?
- answer: religious
  context: 'BYU''s stated mission "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection
    and eternal life." BYU is thus considered by its leaders to be at heart a religious
    institution, wherein, ideally, religious and secular education are interwoven
    in a way that encourages the highest standards in both areas. This weaving of
    the secular and the religious aspects of a religious university goes back as far
    as Brigham Young himself, who told Karl G. Maeser when the Church purchased the
    school: "I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet
    or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God."'
  question: What type of institution do BYU leaders consider it to be at heart?
- answer: King Faisal
  context: While Nasser was in Syria, King Saud planned to have him assassinated on
    his return flight to Cairo. On 4 March, Nasser addressed the masses in Damascus
    and waved before them the Saudi check given to Syrian security chief and Nasser
    supporter Abdel Hamid Sarraj to shoot down Nasser's plane. As a consequence of
    Saud's scheme, he was forced by senior members of the Saudi royal family to informally
    cede most of his powers to his brother, King Faisal, a major opponent of Nasser
    and advocate for pan-Islamic unity over pan-Arabism.
  question: Who assumed power in Saudi Arabia after the failed assassination attempt?
- answer: Proof Sets
  context: The United States Mint produces Proof Sets specifically for collectors
    and speculators. Silver Proofs tend to be the standard designs but with the dime,
    quarter, and half dollar containing 90% silver. Starting in 1983 and ending in
    1997, the Mint also produced proof sets containing the year's commemorative coins
    alongside the regular coins. Another type of proof set is the Presidential Dollar
    Proof Set where four special $1 coins are minted each year featuring a president.
    Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular
    coins, the production of new Presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended
    on December 13, 2011, by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Future minting
    of such coins will be made solely for collectors.
  question: What is specifically produced for collectors?
- answer: Joe Ricketts
  context: The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team located on
    the North Side of Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball
    (MLB) as a members of the National League (NL) Central division; the team plays
    its home baseball games at Wrigley Field. The Cubs are also one of two active
    major league teams based in Chicago; the other is the Chicago White Sox, who are
    a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team is currently owned
    by Thomas S. Ricketts, son of TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts.
  question: Who currently owns the  Chicago Cubs?
- answer: citizen sector organization
  context: "Instead of being defined by \"non\" words, some organizations are suggesting\
    \ new, positive-sounding terminology to describe the sector. The term \"civil\
    \ society organization\" (CSO) has been used by a growing number of organizations,\
    \ such as the Center for the Study of Global Governance. The term \"citizen sector\
    \ organization\" (CSO) has also been advocated to describe the sector \u2013 as\
    \ one of citizens, for citizens \u2013 by organizations such as Ashoka: Innovators\
    \ for the Public. A more broadly applicable term, \"Social Benefit Organization\"\
    \ (SBO) has been advocated for by organizations such as MiniDonations. Advocates\
    \ argue that these terms describe the sector in its own terms, without relying\
    \ on terminology used for the government or business sectors. However, use of\
    \ terminology by a nonprofit of self-descriptive language that is not legally\
    \ compliant risks confusing the public about nonprofit abilities, capabilities\
    \ and limitations."
  question: What is a term being used for organizations that are for the citizens,
    by the citizens?
- answer: eight
  context: "Average attendance for AFL games were around 10,000\u201311,000 per game\
    \ in the 1990s, though during the recession connected to the dot-com bubble and\
    \ the September 11, 2001 attacks average attendance dropped below 10,000 for several\
    \ years. From the start of the 2004 season until the final season of the original\
    \ league in 2008, average attendance was above 12,000, with 12,392 in 2007. Eleven\
    \ of the seventeen teams in operation in 2007 had average attendance figures over\
    \ 13,000. In 2008, the overall attendance average increased to 12,957, with eight\
    \ teams exceeding 13,000 per game."
  question: During the 2008 season, how many teams averaged more than 13,000 spectators
    per game?
- answer: "Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta"
  context: "The term Nederduits, however introduced new confusion, since the non standardised\
    \ dialects spoken in the north of Germany came to be known as Niederdeutsch as\
    \ well, and thus the Duits reference in the name was dropped, leading to Nederlands\
    \ as designation to refer to the Dutch language. The repeated use of Neder (or\
    \ \"low\") to refer to the Dutch language is a reference to the Netherlands' downriver\
    \ location at the Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta near the North Sea, harking\
    \ back to Latin nomenclature, e.g. Germania Inferior. See also: Netherlands (toponymy)."
  question: The Netherlands are "low" because of their placement near what delta by
    the North Sea?
- answer: Tort law
  context: Tort law covers the entire imaginable spectrum of wrongs which humans can
    inflict upon each other, and of course, partially overlaps with wrongs also punishable
    by criminal law. Although the American Law Institute has attempted to standardize
    tort law through the development of several versions of the Restatement of Torts,
    many states have chosen to adopt only certain sections of the Restatements and
    to reject others. Thus, because of its immense size and diversity, American tort
    law cannot be easily summarized.
  question: What covers crimes of human against human?
- answer: Melbourne
  context: In 1839, Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria
    detested) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill
    removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated
    with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel,
    to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to
    appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies
    and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of
    Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became
    known as the bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their
    removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and
    consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.
  question: Who did Victoria reappoint to the position after the Bedchamber Crisis?
- answer: the Brazilian Navy
  context: "One CATOBAR carrier: S\xE3o Paulo is a Clemenceau-class aircraft carrier\
    \ currently in service with the Brazilian Navy. S\xE3o Paulo was first commissioned\
    \ in 1963 by the French Navy as Foch and was transferred in 2000 to Brazil, where\
    \ she became the new flagship of the Brazilian Navy. During the period from 2005\u2013\
    2010, S\xE3o Paulo underwent extensive modernization. At the end of 2010, sea\
    \ trials began, and as of 2011[update] S\xE3o Paulo had been evaluated by the\
    \ CIASA (Inspection Commission and Training Advisory). She was expected to rejoin\
    \ the fleet in late 2013, but suffered another major fire in 2012."
  question: Who is the Sao Paulo currently in service for?
- answer: Spain
  context: As an adolescent, he had a particular love of theology and the Scriptures
    became the foundation of his spirituality. During his studies in Palencia, Spain,
    he experienced a dreadful famine, prompting Dominic to sell all of his beloved
    books and other equipment to help his neighbors. After he completed his studies,
    Bishop Martin Bazan and Prior Diego d'Achebes appointed Dominic to the cathedral
    chapter and he became a regular canon under the Rule of St. Augustine and the
    Constitutions for the cathedral church of Osma. At the age of twenty-four or twenty-five,
    he was ordained to the priesthood.
  question: In what country did Dominic experience a great famine?
- answer: Union Station
  context: "The firm of John Russell Pope designed Broad Street Station as well as\
    \ Branch House on Monument Avenue, designed as a private residence in the Tudor\
    \ style, now serving as the Branch Museum of Architecture and Design. Broad Street\
    \ Station (or Union Station), designed in the Beaux-Arts style, is no longer a\
    \ functioning station but is now home to the Science Museum of Virginia. Main\
    \ Street Station, designed by Wilson, Harris, and Richards, has been returned\
    \ to use in its original purpose. The Jefferson Hotel and the Commonwealth Club\
    \ were both designed by the classically trained Beaux-Arts architects Carr\xE8\

  question: What is another name for Broad Street Station?
- answer: '10'
  context: In Canada, the term "football" may refer to Canadian football and American
    football collectively, or to either sport specifically, depending on context.
    The two sports have shared origins and are closely related but have significant
    differences. In particular, Canadian football has 12 players on the field per
    team rather than 11; the field is roughly 10 yards wider, and 10 yards longer
    between end-zones that are themselves 10 yards deeper; and a team has only three
    downs to gain 10 yards, which results in less offensive rushing than in the American
    game. In the Canadian game all players on the defending team, when a down begins,
    must be at least 1 yard from the line of scrimmage. (The American game has a similar
    "neutral zone" but it is only the length of the football.)
  question: How many yards wider is a Canadian football field than an American football
    field?
- answer: four
  context: The Directorate of Analysis produces all-source intelligence investigation
    on key foreign and intercontinental issues relating to powerful and sometimes
    anti-government sensitive topics. It has four regional analytic groups, six groups
    for transnational issues, and three focus on policy, collection, and staff support.
    There is an office dedicated to Iraq, and regional analytical Offices covering
    the Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, the Office of Russian and European
    Analysis, and the Office of Asian Pacific, Asian Pacific, Latin American, and
    African Analysis and African Analysis.
  question: How many regional analytic groups does the Directorate of Analysis have?
- answer: vermilion
  context: "The Romans liked bright colors, and many Roman villas were decorated with\
    \ vivid red murals. The pigment used for many of the murals was called vermilion,\
    \ and it came from the mineral cinnabar, a common ore of mercury. It was one of\
    \ the finest reds of ancient times \u2013 the paintings have retained their brightness\
    \ for more than twenty centuries. The source of cinnabar for the Romans was a\
    \ group of mines near Almad\xE9n, southwest of Madrid, in Spain. Working in the\
    \ mines was extremely dangerous, since mercury is highly toxic; the miners were\
    \ slaves or prisoners, and being sent to the cinnabar mines was a virtual death\
    \ sentence."
  question: What pigment was used to paint villas in ancient Rome?
- answer: The ends of the segment are frayed, then set in conical zinc molds
  context: Safety testing of mine shaft elevator rails is routinely undertaken. The
    method involves destructive testing of a segment of the cable. The ends of the
    segment are frayed, then set in conical zinc molds. Each end of the segment is
    then secured in a large, hydraulic stretching machine. The segment is then placed
    under increasing load to the point of failure. Data about elasticity, load, and
    other factors is compiled and a report is produced. The report is then analyzed
    to determine whether or not the entire rail is safe to use.
  question: What is  the first step in destructive testing?
- answer: roughly 10,000 depositors
  context: On July 11, 2008, citing liquidity concerns, the FDIC put IndyMac Bank
    into conservatorship. A bridge bank, IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB, was established
    to assume control of IndyMac Bank's assets, its secured liabilities, and its insured
    deposit accounts. The FDIC announced plans to open IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB on
    July 14, 2008. Until then, depositors would have access their insured deposits
    through ATMs, their existing checks, and their existing debit cards. Telephone
    and Internet account access was restored when the bank reopened. The FDIC guarantees
    the funds of all insured accounts up to US$100,000, and has declared a special
    advance dividend to the roughly 10,000 depositors with funds in excess of the
    insured amount, guaranteeing 50% of any amounts in excess of $100,000. Yet, even
    with the pending sale of Indymac to IMB Management Holdings, an estimated 10,000
    uninsured depositors of Indymac are still at a loss of over $270 million.
  question: How many IndyMac account holders held funds in excess of the FDIC's insured
    amount of US$100,000?
- answer: there are twice as many people leaving as entering the job market annually.
  context: "The Thuringian population has a significant sex ratio gap, caused by the\
    \ emigration of young women, especially in rural areas. Overall, there are 115\
    \ to 120 men per 100 women in the 25\u201340 age group (\"family founders\") which\
    \ has negative consequences for the birth ratio. Furthermore, the population is\
    \ getting older and older with some rural municipalities recording more than 30%\
    \ of over-65s (pensioners). This is a problem for the regional labour market,\
    \ as there are twice as many people leaving as entering the job market annually."
  question: What is the problem facing the job market in Thuringia?
- answer: ballad-oriented rock
  context: 'Although dance-oriented, electronic pop and ballad-oriented rock dominated
    the 1980s, soft rock songs still enjoyed a mild success thanks to artists like
    Sheena Easton, Amy Grant, Lionel Richie, Christopher Cross, Dan Hill, Leo Sayer,
    Billy Ocean, Julio Iglesias, Bertie Higgins and Tommy Page. No song spent more
    than six weeks at #1 on this chart during the 1980s, with nine songs accomplishing
    that feat. Two of these were by Lionel Richie, "You Are" in 1983 and "Hello" in
    1984, which also reached #1 on the Hot 100.'
  question: Along with electronic pop, what type of music was the most successful
    in the 1980s?
- answer: the Department of External Affairs
  context: "From the end of World War I until 1962, New Zealand controlled Samoa as\
    \ a Class C Mandate under trusteeship through the League of Nations, then through\
    \ the United Nations. There followed a series of New Zealand administrators who\
    \ were responsible for two major incidents. In the first incident, approximately\
    \ one fifth of the Samoan population died in the influenza epidemic of 1918\u2013\
    1919. Between 1919 and 1962, Samoa was administered by the Department of External\
    \ Affairs, a government department which had been specially created to oversee\
    \ New Zealand's Island Territories and Samoa. In 1943, this Department was renamed\
    \ the Department of Island Territories after a separate Department of External\
    \ Affairs was created to conduct New Zealand's foreign affairs."
  question: What official organization was responsible for Samoa during most of the
    20th century?
- answer: Thirty Years' War
  context: Czech continued to evolve and gain in regional importance for hundreds
    of years, and has been a literary language in the Slovak lands since the early
    fifteenth century. A biblical translation, the Kralice Bible, was published during
    the late sixteenth century (around the time of the King James and Luther versions)
    which was more linguistically conservative than either. The publication of the
    Kralice Bible spawned widespread nationalism, and in 1615 the government of Bohemia
    ruled that only Czech-speaking residents would be allowed to become full citizens
    or inherit goods or land. This, and the conversion of the Czech upper classes
    from the Habsburg Empire's Catholicism to Protestantism, angered the Habsburgs
    and helped trigger the Thirty Years' War (where the Czechs were defeated at the
    Battle of White Mountain). The Czechs became serfs; Bohemia's printing industry
    (and its linguistic and political rights) were dismembered, removing official
    regulation and support from its language. German quickly became the dominant language
    in Bohemia.
  question: In what war were the Czechs defeated at the Battle of White Mountain?
- answer: Common Agricultural Policy
  context: "A Freedom of Information request in 2005 revealed that Eton had received\
    \ \xA32,652 in farming subsidies in 2004 under the Common Agricultural Policy.\
    \ Asked to explain under what grounds it was eligible to receive farming subsidies,\
    \ Eton admitted that it was 'a bit of a mystery'. The TaxPayers' Alliance also\
    \ stated that Eton had received a total of \xA35,300 in CAP subsidies between\
    \ 2002 and 2007. Panorama revealed in March 2012 that farming subsidies were granted\
    \ to Eton for 'environmental improvements', in effect 'being paid without having\
    \ to do any farming at all'."
  question: Under what policy was Eton able to receive funds without farming?
- answer: reduced the effect of surface noise on quiet passages
  context: 'The mid-1970s saw the introduction of dbx-encoded records, again for the
    audiophile niche market. These were completely incompatible with standard record
    playback preamplifiers, relying on the dbx compandor encoding/decoding scheme
    to greatly increase dynamic range (dbx encoded disks were recorded with the dynamic
    range compressed by a factor of two in dB: quiet sounds were meant to be played
    back at low gain and loud sounds were meant to be played back at high gain, via
    automatic gain control in the playback equipment; this reduced the effect of surface
    noise on quiet passages). A similar and very short-lived scheme involved using
    the CBS-developed "CX" noise reduction encoding/decoding scheme.'
  question: What was the intention of DBX encoded recordings?
- answer: 1906 Anglo-Chinese Convention
  context: With respect to these outer regions, the Qing maintained imperial control,
    with the emperor acting as Mongol khan, patron of Tibetan Buddhism and protector
    of Muslims. However, Qing policy changed with the establishment of Xinjiang province
    in 1884. During The Great Game era, taking advantage of the Dungan revolt in northwest
    China, Yaqub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia with support from the British
    Empire, and made himself the ruler of the kingdom of Kashgaria. The Qing court
    sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political
    system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang. The Kumul Khanate,
    which was incorporated into the Qing empire as a vassal after helping Qing defeat
    the Zunghars in 1757, maintained its status after Xinjiang turned into a province
    through the end of the dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution up until 1930. In early
    20th century, Britain sent an expedition force to Tibet and forced Tibetans to
    sign a treaty. The Qing court responded by asserting Chinese sovereignty over
    Tibet, resulting in the 1906 Anglo-Chinese Convention signed between Britain and
    China. The British agreed not to annex Tibetan territory or to interfere in the
    administration of Tibet, while China engaged not to permit any other foreign state
    to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet. Furthermore,
    similar to Xinjiang which was converted into a province earlier, the Qing government
    also turned Manchuria into three provinces in the early 20th century, officially
    known as the "Three Northeast Provinces", and established the post of Viceroy
    of the Three Northeast Provinces to oversee these provinces, making the total
    number of regional viceroys to nine.
  question: What was the name of the agreement between Britain and the Chinese that
    kept the British out of Tibet?
- answer: Some Lutherans, such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church,
    support the doctrine.
  context: 'Martin Luther, who initiated the Protestant Reformation, said: "Mother
    Mary, like us, was born in sin of sinful parents, but the Holy Spirit covered
    her, sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood,
    but not with sinful flesh and blood. The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary
    to remain a true, natural human being of flesh and blood, just as we. However,
    he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a
    pure child, not poisoned by sin as we are. For in that moment when she conceived,
    she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure
    fruit, at once God and truly man, in one person." Some Lutherans, such as the
    members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church, support the doctrine.'
  question: What particular sect is a patron of this belief ?
- answer: poor Whites
  context: After the formal end of Reconstruction, the struggle over power in Southern
    society continued. Through violence and intimidation against freedmen and their
    allies, White Democrats regained political power in Tennessee and other states
    across the South in the late 1870s and 1880s. Over the next decade, the state
    legislature passed increasingly restrictive laws to control African Americans.
    In 1889 the General Assembly passed four laws described as electoral reform, with
    the cumulative effect of essentially disfranchising most African Americans in
    rural areas and small towns, as well as many poor Whites. Legislation included
    implementation of a poll tax, timing of registration, and recording requirements.
    Tens of thousands of taxpaying citizens were without representation for decades
    into the 20th century. Disfranchising legislation accompanied Jim Crow laws passed
    in the late 19th century, which imposed segregation in the state. In 1900, African
    Americans made up nearly 24% of the state's population, and numbered 480,430 citizens
    who lived mostly in the central and western parts of the state.
  question: Who besides African Americans were victims of Tennessee's late-19th century
    electoral reform?
- answer: '1845'
  context: 'Other Christian denominations on the island include: Roman Catholic (since
    1852), Salvation Army (since 1884), Baptist (since 1845) and, in more recent times,
    Seventh-day Adventist (since 1949), New Apostolic and Jehovah''s Witnesses (of
    which one in 35 residents is a member, the highest ratio of any country). The
    Catholics are pastorally served by the Mission sui iuris of Saint Helena, Ascension
    and Tristan da Cunha, whose office of ecclesiastical superior is vested in the

- answer: '1975'
  context: 'East Tucson is relatively new compared to other parts of the city, developed
    between the 1950s and the 1970s,[citation needed] with developments such as Desert
    Palms Park. It is generally classified as the area of the city east of Swan Road,
    with above-average real estate values relative to the rest of the city. The area
    includes urban and suburban development near the Rincon Mountains. East Tucson
    includes Saguaro National Park East. Tucson''s "Restaurant Row" is also located
    on the east side, along with a significant corporate and financial presence. Restaurant
    Row is sandwiched by three of Tucson''s storied Neighborhoods: Harold Bell Wright
    Estates, named after the famous author''s ranch which occupied some of that area
    prior to the depression; the Tucson Country Club (the third to bear the name Tucson
    Country Club), and the Dorado Country Club. Tucson''s largest office building
    is 5151 East Broadway in east Tucson, completed in 1975. The first phases of Williams
    Centre, a mixed-use, master-planned development on Broadway near Craycroft Road,
    were opened in 1987. Park Place, a recently renovated shopping center, is also
    located along Broadway (west of Wilmot Road).'
  question: What year was Tuscon's largest office building built?
- answer: Daniel J. Jenkins
  context: The Jenkins Orphanage was established in 1891 by the Rev. Daniel J. Jenkins
    in Charleston. The orphanage accepted donations of musical instruments and Rev.
    Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and Avery Institute Graduates to tutor
    the boys in music. As a result, Charleston musicians became proficient on a variety
    of instruments and were able to read music expertly. These traits set Jenkins
    musicians apart and helped land some of them positions in big bands with Duke
    Ellington and Count Basie. William "Cat" Anderson, Jabbo Smith, and Freddie Green
    are but a few of the alumni from the Jenkins Orphanage band who became professional
    musicians in some of the best bands of the day. Orphanages around the country
    began to develop brass bands in the wake of the Jenkins Orphanage Band's success.
    At the Colored Waif's Home Brass Band in New Orleans, for example, a young trumpeter
    named Louis Armstrong first began to draw attention.
  question: What Charleston Reverend established the Jenkins Orphanage?
- answer: coal, oil, natural gas, and hydro power
  context: Egypt has a developed energy market based on coal, oil, natural gas, and
    hydro power. Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the
    rate of about 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons) per year.
    Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions, the Gulf of Suez, and
    the Nile Delta. Egypt has huge reserves of gas, estimated at 2,180 cubic kilometres
    (520 cu mi), and LNG up to 2012 exported to many countries. In 2013, the Egyptian
    General Petroleum Co (EGPC) said the country will cut exports of natural gas and
    tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis and
    stave off political unrest, Reuters has reported. Egypt is counting on top liquid
    natural gas (LNG) exporter Qatar to obtain additional gas volumes in summer, while
    encouraging factories to plan their annual maintenance for those months of peak
    demand, said EGPC chairman, Tarek El Barkatawy. Egypt produces its own energy,
    but has been a net oil importer since 2008 and is rapidly becoming a net importer
    of natural gas.
  question: What is Egypts energy market based upon?
- answer: Multidimensional Pain Inventory
  context: 'The Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) is a questionnaire designed
    to assess the psychosocial state of a person with chronic pain. Analysis of MPI
    results by Turk and Rudy (1988) found three classes of chronic pain patient: "(a)
    dysfunctional, people who perceived the severity of their pain to be high, reported
    that pain interfered with much of their lives, reported a higher degree of psychological
    distress caused by pain, and reported low levels of activity; (b) interpersonally
    distressed, people with a common perception that significant others were not very
    supportive of their pain problems; and (c) adaptive copers, patients who reported
    high levels of social support, relatively low levels of pain and perceived interference,
    and relatively high levels of activity." Combining the MPI characterization of
    the person with their IASP five-category pain profile is recommended for deriving
    the most useful case description.'
  question: What is MPI an abbreviation for?
- answer: Dutch
  context: In the east there is a Dutch Low Saxon dialect area, comprising the provinces
    of Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel, and parts of the province of Gelderland
    as well. The IJssel river roughly forms the linguistic watershed here. This group,
    though not being Low Franconian and being close to the neighbouring Low German,
    is regarded as Dutch, because of a number of reasons. From the 14th to 15th century
    onward, its urban centers (Deventer, Zwolle and Kampen as well as Zutphen and
    Doesburg) have been increasingly influenced by the western written Dutch and became
    a linguistically mixed area. From the 17th century onward, it was gradually integrated
    into the Dutch language area. In other words, this group is Dutch synchronically
    but not diachronically.[citation needed]
  question: Although Dutch Low Saxon is similar to Low German, it's synchronically
    included with which language?
- answer: aspirated stops.
  context: "Some forms of Greek before the Koine Greek period are reconstructed as\
    \ having aspirated stops. The Classical Attic dialect of Ancient Greek had a three-way\
    \ distinction in stops like Eastern Armenian: /t t\u02B0 d/. These stops were\
    \ called \u03C8\u03B9\u03BB\u03AC, \u03B4\u03B1\u03C3\u03AD\u03B1, \u03BC\u03AD\
    \u03C3\u03B1 \"thin, thick, middle\" by Koine Greek grammarians."
  question: Early Greek (before Koine) have been redone with what?
- answer: psychoanalysis
  context: Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence
    in the mid-20th century in response to Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory and
    B. F. Skinner's Behaviorism. The approach emphasizes an individual's inherent
    drive towards self-actualization and creativity. Psychologists Carl Rogers and
    Abraham Maslow introduced a positive, humanistic psychology in response to what
    they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s.
    Other sources include the philosophies of existentialism and phenomenology.
  question: They introduced it in response to what?
- answer: Echmiadzin
  context: Armenia established a Church that still exists independently of both the
    Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches, having become so in 451 AD as a result
    of its stance regarding the Council of Chalcedon. Today this church is known as
    the Armenian Apostolic Church, which is a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion,
    not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion. During its later political
    eclipses, Armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity.
    The original location of the Armenian Catholicosate is Echmiadzin. However, the
    continuous upheavals, which characterized the political scenes of Armenia, made
    the political power move to safer places. The Church center moved as well to different
    locations together with the political authority. Therefore, it eventually moved
    to Cilicia as the Holy See of Cilicia.
  question: Where was the Armenian Catholicosate located at first?
- answer: wild teosinte grasses
  context: "Over the course of thousands of years, American indigenous peoples domesticated,\
    \ bred and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute\
    \ 50\u201360% of all crops in cultivation worldwide. In certain cases, the indigenous\

    \ as was the case in the domestication and breeding of maize from wild teosinte\
    \ grasses in the valleys of southern Mexico. Numerous such agricultural products\
    \ retain their native names in the English and Spanish lexicons."
  question: What was the origin of maize?
- answer: only allowed as an event in Trampoline gymnastics meets
  context: In tumbling, athletes perform an explosive series of flips and twists down
    a sprung tumbling track. Scoring is similar to trampolining. Tumbling was originally
    contested as one of the events in Men's Artistic Gymnastics at the 1932 Summer
    Olympics, and in 1955 and 1959 at the Pan American Games. From 1974 to 1998 it
    was included as an event for both genders at the Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships.
    The event has also been contested since 1976 at the Trampoline World Championships.
    Since the recognition of Trampoline and Acrobatic Gymnastics as FIG disciplines
    in 1999, official Tumbling competitions are only allowed as an event in Trampoline
    gymnastics meets.
  question: Where are offical tumbling competitions allowed?
- answer: Johann Voldemar Jannsen, Jakob Hurt and Carl Robert Jakobson.
  context: As a result of the abolition of serfdom and the availability of education
    to the native Estonian-speaking population, an active Estonian nationalist movement
    developed in the 19th century.[citation needed] It began on a cultural level,
    resulting in the establishment of Estonian language literature, theatre and professional
    music and led on to the formation of the Estonian national identity and the Age
    of Awakening. Among the leaders of the movement were Johann Voldemar Jannsen,
    Jakob Hurt and Carl Robert Jakobson.
  question: Who were the leaders of the Age of Awakening?
- answer: parliamentary democracies
  context: Ireland, the United Kingdom and the three Crown Dependencies are all parliamentary
    democracies, with their own separate parliaments. All parts of the United Kingdom
    return members to parliament in London. In addition to this, voters in Scotland,
    Wales and Northern Ireland return members to a parliament in Edinburgh and to
    assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast respectively. Governance in the norm is by majority
    rule, however, Northern Ireland uses a system of power sharing whereby unionists
    and nationalists share executive posts proportionately and where the assent of
    both groups are required for the Northern Ireland Assembly to make certain decisions.
    (In the context of Northern Ireland, unionists are those who want Northern Ireland
    to remain a part of the United Kingdom and nationalists are those who want Northern
    Ireland join with the rest of Ireland.) The British monarch is the head of state
    for all parts of the isles except for the Republic of Ireland, where the head
    of state is the President of Ireland.
  question: What type of government does the United Kingdom and the Crown Dependencies
    have?
- answer: documentaries
  context: On 1 July 1967, BBC Two became the first television channel in Europe to
    broadcast regularly in colour, using the West German PAL system that is still
    in use today although being gradually superseded by digital systems. (BBC One
    and ITV began 625-line colour broadcasts simultaneously on 15 November 1969).
    Unlike other terrestrial channels, BBC Two does not have soap opera or standard
    news programming, but a range of programmes intended to be eclectic and diverse
    (although if a programme has high audience ratings it is often eventually repositioned
    to BBC One). The different remit of BBC2 allowed its first controller, Sir David
    Attenborough to commission the first heavyweight documentaries and documentary
    series such as Civilisation, The Ascent of Man and Horizon.
  question: What kinds of programs did Attenborough favor?
- answer: Landshut Maneuver
  context: "In the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army\
    \ crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. The early Austrian attack surprised\
    \ the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion.\
    \ He arrived at Donauw\xF6rth on the 17th to find the Grande Arm\xE9e in a dangerous\
    \ position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together\
    \ by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French\
    \ army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response,\
    \ Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut\
    \ Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards\
    \ the town of Eckm\xFChl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting\
    \ Battle of Eckm\xFChl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube\
    \ and into Bohemia. On 13 May, Vienna fell for the second time in four years,\
    \ although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the\
    \ initial engagements in Southern Germany."
  question: What was the name of the plan Napoleon devised to cut off the Austrians
    during battle?
- answer: Dominik Dziewanowski
  context: "During 1824\u201328 Chopin spent his vacations away from Warsaw, at a\
    \ number of locales.[n 4] In 1824 and 1825, at Szafarnia, he was a guest of Dominik\
    \ Dziewanowski, the father of a schoolmate. Here for the first time he encountered\
    \ Polish rural folk music. His letters home from Szafarnia (to which he gave the\
    \ title \"The Szafarnia Courier\"), written in a very modern and lively Polish,\
    \ amused his family with their spoofing of the Warsaw newspapers and demonstrated\
    \ the youngster's literary gift."
  question: "Who was Fr\xE9d\xE9ric a guest of during his visit of Szafarnia in 1824\
    \ and 1825?"
- answer: '90'
  context: Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is
    very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games
    a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who
    play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games,
    most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping
    coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season
    limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason
    games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and
    traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted
    on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice
    common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games
    on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has
    played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American
    Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type
    was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually
    canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents,
    with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a
    team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in
    1976. Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to
    pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket
    package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against
    the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful
    in halting it.[citation needed] The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the end
    of the NFL season (since 2011 is played the week prior to the Super Bowl), is
    also considered an exhibition game.
  question: How many players can an NFL team have in the off-season?
- answer: mother Donda West
  context: On January 5, 2012, West announced his establishment of the creative content
    company DONDA, named after his late mother Donda West. In his announcement, West
    proclaimed that the company would "pick up where Steve Jobs left off"; DONDA would
    operate as "a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers in a creative
    space to bounce their dreams and ideas" with the "goal to make products and experiences
    that people want and can afford." West is notoriously secretive about the company's
    operations, maintaining neither an official website nor a social media presence.
    In stating DONDA's creative philosophy, West articulated the need to "put creatives
    in a room together with like minds" in order to "simplify and aesthetically improve
    everything we see, taste, touch, and feel.". Contemporary critics have noted the
    consistent minimalistic aesthetic exhibited throughout DONDA creative projects.
  question: Kanye's creative content company DONDA was named after who?
- answer: Mother of God
  context: "Mary is referred to by the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy,\
    \ the Anglican Church, and all Eastern Catholic Churches as Theotokos, a title\
    \ recognized at the Third Ecumenical Council (held at Ephesus to address the teachings\
    \ of Nestorius, in 431). Theotokos (and its Latin equivalents, \"Deipara\" and\
    \ \"Dei genetrix\") literally means \"Godbearer\". The equivalent phrase \"Mater\
    \ Dei\" (Mother of God) is more common in Latin and so also in the other languages\
    \ used in the Western Catholic Church, but this same phrase in Greek (\u039C\u03AE\
    \u03C4\u03B7\u03C1 \u0398\u03B5\u03BF\u1FE6), in the abbreviated form of the first\
    \ and last letter of the two words (\u039C\u03A1 \u0398\u03A5), is the indication\
    \ attached to her image in Byzantine icons. The Council stated that the Church\
    \ Fathers \"did not hesitate to speak of the holy Virgin as the Mother of God\"\
    ."
  question: What does the phrase "Mater Dei" mean?
- answer: wealth
  context: 'The religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular consists of an
    iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as: Bhavani, Durga, Gaja-Lakshmi,
    Hariti-Sitala, Mahsishamardini, Saptamatrika (seven mother goddesses), and Sri-Lakshmi(wealth-goddess).
    From the 3rd century BC, apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses, Buddhist monuments
    from the Ashokan period (it is said that Ashoka visited Nepal in 250 BC) have
    embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular. These art and architectural
    edifices encompass three major periods of evolution: the Licchavi or classical
    period (500 to 900 AD), the post-classical period (1000 to 1400 AD), with strong
    influence of the Palla art form; the Malla period (1400 onwards) that exhibited
    explicitly tantric influences coupled with the art of Tibetan Demonology.'
  question: What is Sri-Lakshmi a deity of?
- answer: lower-tier FBS, Football Championship, or Division II schools
  context: However, most of the major FBS teams annually schedule early season non-conference
    preseason home games against lesser opponents that are lower-tier FBS, Football
    Championship, or Division II schools, which often result in lopsided victories
    in favor of the FBS teams and act as exhibition games in all but name, though
    they additionally provide a large appearance fee and at least one guaranteed television
    appearance for the smaller school. These games also receive the same criticism
    as NFL exhibition games, but instead it is targeted to schools scheduling low-quality
    opponents and the simplicity for a team to run up the score against a weak opponent.
    However, these games are susceptible to backfiring, resulting in damage in poll
    position and public perception, especially if the higher ranked team loses, although
    the mere act of scheduling a weak opponent is harmful to a team's overall strength
    of schedule itself. Games an FBS team schedules against lower division opponents
    do not count toward the minimum seven wins required for bowl eligibility, and
    only one game against an FCS team can be counted. With the start of the College
    Football Playoff system for the 2014 season, major teams are now discouraged from
    scheduling weaker opponents for their non-conference schedule because of a much
    higher emphasis on strength of schedule than in the Bowl Championship Series era.
  question: Major FBS teams can have lopsided victories against what kinds of lesser
    opponents?
- answer: Truman Capote
  context: 'Lee''s childhood friend, author Truman Capote, wrote on the dust jacket
    of the first edition, "Someone rare has written this very fine first novel: a
    writer with the liveliest sense of life, and the warmest, most authentic sense
    of humor. A touching book; and so funny, so likeable." This comment has been construed
    to suggest that Capote wrote the book or edited it heavily. In 2003, a Tuscaloosa
    newspaper quoted Capote''s biological father, Archulus Persons, as claiming that
    Capote had written "almost all" of the book. In 2006, a Capote letter was donated
    to Monroeville''s literary heritage museum; in a letter to a neighbor in Monroeville
    in 1959, Capote mentioned that Lee was writing a book that was to be published
    soon. Extensive notes between Lee and her editor at Lippincott also refute the
    rumor of Capote''s authorship. Lee''s older sister, Alice, responded to the rumor,
    saying: "That''s the biggest lie ever told."'
  question: Who was rumored to have written the book instead of Lee?
- answer: regional nationalism
  context: "On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian\
    \ Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the\
    \ club's offices. A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a\
    \ symbol of the \"undisciplined\" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486\
    \ members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism,\
    \ including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout\
    \ Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish\
    \ names. These measures forced the club to change its name to Club de F\xFAtbol\
    \ Barcelona and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest."
  question: What kind of signs were removed form club Barcelona?
- answer: constables
  context: All police officers in the United Kingdom, whatever their actual rank,
    are 'constables' in terms of their legal position. This means that a newly appointed
    constable has the same arrest powers as a Chief Constable or Commissioner. However,
    certain higher ranks have additional powers to authorize certain aspects of police
    operations, such as a power to authorize a search of a suspect's house (section
    18 PACE in England and Wales) by an officer of the rank of Inspector, or the power
    to authorize a suspect's detention beyond 24 hours by a Superintendent.
  question: What is the legal status of UK police officers?
- answer: testing an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills
  context: White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing,
    transparent box testing and structural testing, by seeing the source code) tests
    internal structures or workings of a program, as opposed to the functionality
    exposed to the end-user. In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system,
    as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases. The tester chooses
    inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the appropriate outputs.
    This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (ICT).
  question: Which two procedures are used to design test cases in White-box testing?
