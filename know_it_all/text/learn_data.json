        "text": "Computational and Inferential Thinking  The Foundations of Data Science  By Ani Adhikari and John DeNero  Contributions by David Wagner  What is Data Science  Data Science is about drawing useful conclusions from large and diverse data sets through exploration , prediction , and inference . Exploration involves identifying patterns in information . Prediction involves using information we know to make informed guesses about values we wish we knew . Inference involves quantifying our degree of certainty : will those patterns we found also appear in new observations ? How accurate are our predictions ? Our primary tools for exploration are visualizations and descriptive statistics , for prediction are machine learning and optimization , and for inference are statistical tests and models .  Statistics is a central component of data science because statistics studies how to make robust conclusions with incomplete information . Computing is a central component because programming allows us to apply analysis techniques to the large and diverse data sets that arise in real - world applications : not just numbers , but text , images , videos , and sensor readings . Data science is all of these things , but it more than the sum of its parts because of the applications ."

Computers enable a family of methods based on resampling that apply to a wide range of different inference problems , take into account all available information , and require few assumptions or conditions . Although these techniques have often been reserved for graduate courses in statistics , their flexibility and simplicity are a natural fit for data science applications .  Why Data Science ?  Most important decisions are made with only partial information and uncertain outcomes . However , the degree of uncertainty for many decisions can be reduced sharply by public access to large data sets and the computational tools required to analyze them effectively . Data - driven decision making has already transformed a tremendous breadth of industries , including finance , advertising , manufacturing , and real estate . At the same time , a wide range of academic disciplines are evolving rapidly to incorporate large - scale data analysis into their theory and practice . "

Is chocolate good for you ? What causes breast cancer ?  All of these questions attempt to assign a cause to an effect . A careful examination of data can help shed light on questions like these . In this section you will learn some of the fundamental concepts involved in establishing causality .  Observation is a key to good science . An observational study is one in which scientists make conclusions based on data that they have observed but had no hand in generating . In data science , many such studies involve observations on a group of individuals , a factor of interest called a treatment , and an outcome measured on each individual .  It is easiest to think of the individuals as people . In a study of whether chocolate is good for the health , the individuals would indeed be people , the treatment would be eating chocolate , and the outcome might be a measure of blood pressure . But individuals in observational studies need not be people . In a study of whether the death penalty has a deterrent effect , the individuals could be the 50 states of the union ."

To get your mind into the right timeframe , try to imagine London in the 1850 \u2019s . It was the world \u2019s wealthiest city but many of its people were desperately poor . Charles Dickens , then at the height of his fame , was writing about their plight . Disease was rife in the poorer parts of the city , and cholera was among the most feared .

Establishing Causality  In the language developed earlier in the section , you can think of the people in the S&V houses as the treatment group , and those in the Lambeth houses at the control group . A crucial element in Snow \u2019s analysis was that the people in the two groups were comparable to each other , apart from the treatment .  In order to establish whether it was the water supply that was causing cholera , Snow had to compare two groups that were similar to each other in all but one aspect\u2013their water supply . Only then would he be able to ascribe the differences in their outcomes to the water supply . If the two groups had been different in some other way as well , it would have been difficult to point the finger at the water supply as the source of the disease . For example , if the treatment group consisted of factory workers and the control group did not , then differences between the outcomes in the two groups could have been due to the water supply , or to factory work , or both , or to any other characteristic that made the groups different from each other . The final picture would have been much more fuzzy .  Snow \u2019s brilliance lay in identifying two groups that would make his comparison clear ."

An underlying difference between the two groups ( other than the treatment ) is called a confounding factor , because it might confound you ( that is , mess you up ) when you try to reach a conclusion .  Example : Coffee and lung cancer . Studies in the 1960 \u2019s showed that coffee drinkers had higher rates of lung cancer than those who did not drink coffee .

Randomized controlled experiments have long been a gold standard in the medical field , for example in establishing whether a new drug works . They are also becoming more commonly used in other fields such as economics .  Example : Welfare subsidies in Mexico . In Mexican villages in the 1990 \u2019s , children in poor families were often not enrolled in school . One of the reasons was that the older children could go to work and thus help support the family . Santiago Levy , a minister in Mexican Ministry of Finance , set out to investigate whether welfare programs could be used to increase school enrollment and improve health conditions . He conducted an RCT on a set of villages , selecting some of them at random to receive a new welfare program called PROGRESA.

        "text": "But every method of randomization consists of a sequence of carefully defined steps that allow chances to be specified mathematically . This has two important consequences .  It allows us to account\u2013mathematically\u2013for the possibility that randomization produces treatment and control groups that are quite different from each other .  It allows us to make precise mathematical statements about differences between the treatment and control groups . This in turn helps us make justifiable conclusions about whether the treatment has any effect .  In this course , you will learn how to conduct and analyze your own randomized experiments . That will involve more detail than has been presented in this section . For now , just focus on the main idea : to try to establish causality , run a randomized controlled experiment if possible . If you are conducting an observational study , you might be able to establish association but not causation . Be extremely careful about confounding factors before making conclusions about causality based on an observational study . "

She had no time for theories about contagion and germs , and was not one for mincing her words . \u201c There is no end to the absurdities connected with this doctrine , \u201d she said . \u201c Suffice it to say that in the ordinary sense of the word , there is no proof such as would be admitted in any scientific enquiry that there is any such thing as contagion . \u201d  A later RCT established that the conditions on which PROGRESA insisted \u2013 children going to school , preventive health care \u2013 were not necessary to achieve increased enrollment . Just the financial boost of the welfare payments was sufficient .  Good reads  The Strange Case of the Broad Street Pump : John Snow and the Mystery of Cholera by Sandra Hempel , published by our own University of California Press , reads like a whodunit . It was one of the main sources for this section 's account of John Snow and his work . A word of warning : some of the contents of the book are stomach - churning .  Poor Economics , the best seller by Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo of MIT , is an accessible and lively account of ways to fight global poverty ."
