C: *Tort law* covers the entire imaginable spectrum of wrongs which humans can
inflict upon each other, and of course, partially overlaps with wrongs also punishable
by criminal law. Although the American Law Institute has attempted to standardize
tort law through the development of several versions of the Restatement of Torts,
many states have chosen to adopt only certain sections of the Restatements and
to reject others. Thus, because of its immense size and diversity, American tort
law cannot be easily summarized.
A: Tort law
Q: What covers crimes of human against human?

C: Instead of being defined by "non" words, some organizations are suggesting
 new, positive-sounding terminology to describe the sector. The term "*civil
society organization*" (CSO) has been used by a growing number of organizations,
such as the Center for the Study of Global Governance. The term "citizen sector
organization" (CSO) has also been advocated to describe the sector u2013 as
one of citizens, for citizens u2013 by organizations such as Ashoka: Innovators
for the Public. A more broadly applicable term, "Social Benefit Organization"
(SBO) has been advocated for by organizations such as MiniDonations. Advocates
argue that these terms describe the sector in its own terms, without relying
on terminology used for the government or business sectors. However, use of
terminology by a nonprofit of self-descriptive language that is not legally
compliant risks confusing the public about nonprofit abilities, capabilities
and limitations.
A: citizen sector organization
Q: What is a term being used for organizations that are for the citizens, by the citizens?

C:The temperatures in the inner layers are much higher than the outside layers
because of the heat produced by Saturn's interior.[17] Saturn's winds are some
of the fastest in the Solar System, reaching 1,800 km/h (1,118 mph),[18] ten
times faster then winds on Earth.[19]   Saturn's atmosphere is also known to
form *oval shaped clouds*, similar to the clearer spots seen in Jupiter.
A: oval shaped clouds 
Q: What are some of the shapes of clouds in Saturn's atmosphere?
