                        "As the wind blows against the mountains, it is forced upward and moisture condenses, forming a cloud that stays stationary until the uplift or moisture feed ends.",
                        "Although these clouds could produce precipitation if dense enough, they are mainly an indicator of air turbulence downstream.",
                        "However, due to their unique shape, many times they have been mistaken for UFO sightings!",
